% As specified by user input, runs regular and irregular WEC-Sim runs for
% RM3, plots a comparison of simulation results vs. stored verification
% runs, and plots solver-to-solver comparison.

%% User Input
global plotNO;
runReg=1;       % 1 to run regular wave simulations
runIrreg=0;     % 1 to run irregular wave simulations
runYaw=0;       % 1 to run passive yaw simulations
plotNO=0;       % 1 to plot new run vs. stored run for comparison of each solver
plotSolvers=0;  % 1 to plot new run comparison by sln method
openCompare=0;  % 1 opens all new run vs. stored run plots for comparison of each solver
