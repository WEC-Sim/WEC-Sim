## Source Code Management

A stable version of WEC-Sim is maintained on the [master branch](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim) of WEC-Sim, and stable [releases](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/releases) of WEC-Sim are tagged on GitHub. 
WEC-Sim development is performed on the dev branch using a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow). 
New WEC-Sim features are developed on forks of the WEC-Sim repository, and [pull-requests](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/pulls) are submitted to merge new features from a development fork into the main WEC-Sim repository. 
When submitting a pull-request for a new WEC-Sim feature, pull-requests should be submitted to the [dev branch](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/tree/dev). 
The only exception to this workflow is for bug fixes, pull-request for bug fixes should be should submitted to the [master branch](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim).
