## Source Code Management

A stable version of WEC-Sim is maintained on WEC-Sim's [master branch](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim), and WEC-Sim [releases](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/releases) are tagged on GitHub. 
WEC-Sim development is performed on WEC-Sim's [dev branch](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/tree/dev) using a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow). 
New WEC-Sim features are developed on forks of the WEC-Sim repository, and [pull-requests](https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/pulls) are submitted to merge new features from a development fork into the main WEC-Sim repository. 
Pull requests for new WEC-Sim features should be submitted to the WEC-Sim dev branch. 
The only exception to this workflow is for bug fixes; pull requests for bug fixes should be should submitted to the WEC-Sim master branch.
When a new version of WEC-Sim is released, the dev branch becomes the master branch, and all updates are included in the tagged release.
