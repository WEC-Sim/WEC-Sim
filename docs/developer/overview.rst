Overview
========

The :ref:`WEC-Sim development team <developers>` 
is currently engaged in continuous code development and support. Efforts are 
made by the development team to improve the code's flexibility, accuracy, and 
usability. The :ref:`dev-getting-started` section describes the development
team's current workflow for users who wish to submit features and ehancements
for consideration. The rest of the developer manual attempts to document specific
complexities and choices made during code development for user's reference. It 
is intended as a reference for users and members of the large development team
when creating new features. This is done in the hopes of creating a sustainable
software that can outlive any possible cease in development efforts.
