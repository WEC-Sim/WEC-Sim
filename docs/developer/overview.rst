The :ref:`WEC-Sim development team <developers>` is currently engaged in continuous code development and support. 
Efforts are made by the development team to improve the code's flexibility, accuracy, and usability. 
The :ref:`dev-getting-started` section describes the development team's workflow for anyone who wishes to submit new WEC-Sim features for inclusion in future WEC-Sim releases. 
The developer manual also documents specific WEC-Sim features that are especially relevant to WEC-Sim development. 
It is intended as a reference for members of the (internal and external) development team when adding new features.
