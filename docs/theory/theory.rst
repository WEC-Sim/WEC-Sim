Overview
--------

Modeling wave energy converters (WECs) involves the interaction between the 
incident waves, device motion, power-take-off (PTO mechanism), and mooring. 
WEC-Sim uses a radiation and diffraction method :cite:`Li2012,Babarit2012` to 
predict power performance and design optimization. The radiation and 
diffraction method generally obtains the hydrodynamic forces from a 
frequency-domain boundary element method (BEM) solver using linear coefficients 
to solve the system dynamics in the time domain.

Coordinate System
-----------------

The :ref:`WEC-Sim Coordinate System <coordinate_system>` figure illustrates a 
3-D floating point absorber subject to incoming waves in water. The figure also 
defines the coordinates and the 6 degree of freedom (DOF) in WEC-Sim. The 
WEC-Sim coordinate system assumes that the positive X-axis defines a wave angle 
heading of zero (e.g., a wave propagating with along a zero-degree direction is 
moving in the +X direction). The positive Z-axis is in the vertical upwards 
direction, and the positive Y-axis direction is defined by the right-hand rule. 
In the vectors and matrices used in the code, Surge (x), Sway (y), and Heave 
(z) correspond to the first, second and third position respectively. Roll (Rx), 
Pitch (Ry), and Yaw (Rz) correspond to the fourth, fifth, and sixth position 
respectively.

Units
-----

All units within WEC-Sim are in the MKS (meters-kilograms-seconds system) and 
angular measurements are specified in radians (except for wave directionality 
which is defined in degrees). 

Boundary Element Method (BEM)
-----------------------------

In WEC-Sim, wave forcing components are modeled using linear coefficients 
obtained from a frequency-domain potential flow Boundary Element Method (BEM) 
solver (e.g., WAMIT :cite:`Lee2006`, Aqwa :cite:`AQWA`, NEMOH :cite:`NEMOH`, and Capytaine :cite:`ancellin2019,babarit2015`). 
The BEM solutions are obtained by solving the Laplace equation 
for the velocity potential, which assumes the flow is inviscid, incompressible, 
and irrotational. More details on the theory for the frequency-domain BEM can 
be found in :cite:`Lee2006`. 

WEC-Sim imports nondimensionalized hydrodynamic coefficients from an ``*.h5`` 
data structure generated by :ref:`user-advanced-features-bemio` for the BEM solvers: WAMIT, 
Aqwa, NEMOH or Capytaine. Alternatively, the ``*.h5`` data structure can be 
manually defined by the user. The WEC-Sim code scales the hydrodynamic 
coefficients according to the equations below, where :math:`\rho` is the water 
density, :math:`\omega` is the wave frequency in rad/s, and :math:`g` is 
gravity: 

.. math::
    :nowrap:
    
    \begin{gather*}
    |\overline{F_{exc}(\omega)}| = \frac{|F_{exc}(\omega)|}{\rho g} \\
    \overline{A(\omega)}         = \frac{A(\omega)}{\rho} \\
    \overline{B(\omega)}         = \frac{B(\omega)}{\rho \omega} \\
    \overline{K_{hs}}            = \frac{K_{hs}}{\rho g}
    \end{gather*}

where :math:`F_{exc}` is the wave-excitation force and torque vector, :math:`A` 
is the radiation added mass coefficient, :math:`B` is the radiation wave 
damping coefficient, and :math:`K_{hs}` is the linear hydrostatic restoring 
coefficient. 


.. _theory-time-domain:

Time-Domain Formulation
-----------------------

A common approach to determining the hydrodynamic forces is to use linear wave 
theory which assumes the waves are the sum of incident, radiated, and 
diffracted wave components. The dynamic response of the system is calculated by 
solving WEC system equations of motion :cite:`Babarit2012,Nolte2014`. The 
equation of motion for a floating body about its center of gravity can be given 
as: 

.. math::

    m\ddot{X}=F_{exc}(t)+F_{md}(t)+F_{rad}(t)+F_{pto}(t)+F_{v}(t)+F_{me}(t)+F_{B}(t)+F_{m}(t)


where :math:`\ddot{X}` is the (translational and rotational) acceleration 
vector of the device, :math:`m` is the mass matrix, :math:`F_{exc}(t)` is the 
wave excitation force and torque (6-element) vector,  :math:`F_{md}(t)` is the 
mean drift force and torque vector, :math:`F_{rad}(t)` is the 
force and torque vector resulting from wave radiation, :math:`F_{pto}(t)` is 
the PTO force and torque vector, :math:`F_{v}(t)` is the damping force and 
torque vector, :math:`F_{me}(t)` is the Morison Element force and torque 
vector, :math:`F_{B}(t)` is the net buoyancy restoring force and torque vector, 
and :math:`F_{m}(t)` is the force and torque vector resulting from the mooring 
connection. 

:math:`F_{exc}(t)` , :math:`F_{rad}(t)` , and :math:`F_{B}(t)` are calculated 
using hydrodynamic coefficients provided by the frequency-domain BEM solver. 
The radiation term includes an added-mass term, matrix :math:`A(\omega)`, and 
wave damping term, matrix :math:`B(\omega)`, associated with the acceleration 
and velocity of the floating body, respectively, and given as functions of 
radian frequency (:math:`\omega`) by the BEM solver. The wave excitation term 
:math:`F_{exc}(\omega)` includes a Froude-Krylov force component generated by 
the undisturbed incident waves and a diffraction component that results from 
the presence of the floating body. The buoyancy term :math:`F_{B}(t)` depends 
on the hydrostatic stiffness :math:`K_{hs}` coefficient, displacement of the 
body, and its mass. 

Numerical Methods
------------------

WEC-Sim can be used for regular and irregular wave simulations, but note that 
:math:`F_{rad}(t)` is calculated differently for 
sinusoidal steady-state response scenarios and random sea simulations. The 
sinusoidal steady-state response is often used for simple WEC designs with 
regular incoming waves. However, for random sea simulations or any simulations 
where fluid memory effects of the system are essential, the convolution 
integral method is recommended to represent the fluid memory retardation force 
on the floating body. To speed computation of the convolution integral, the 
state space representation method can be specified to approximate this 
calculation as a system of linear ordinary differential equations. 

Ramp Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ramp function (:math:`R_{f}`), necessary to avoid strong transient flows at 
the earlier time steps of the simulation, is used to calculate the wave 
excitation force. The ramp function is given by 

.. math::

    R_{f}(t)=\begin{cases}
    \frac{1}{2}(1+\cos(\pi+\frac{\pi t}{t_{r}})) & \frac{t}{t_{r}}<1\\
    1 & \frac{t}{t_{r}}\geq1
    \end{cases}

where :math:`t` is the simulation time and :math:`t_{r}` is the ramp time.

Sinusoidal Steady-State Response 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This approach assumes that the system response is in sinusoidal steady-state 
form; therefore, it is only valid for regular wave simulations. The radiation 
term can be calculated using the added mass and the wave radiation damping term 
for a given wave frequency, which is obtained from 


.. math::

    F_{rad}(t)=-A(\omega)\ddot{X}-B(\omega)\dot{X}

where :math:`\dot{X}` is the velocity vector of the floating body, 
:math:`A(\omega)` is the added mass matrix, and :math:`B(\omega)` is the 
radiation damping matrix. 

The free surface profile is based on linear wave theory for a given wave 
height, wave frequency, and water depth. The regular wave excitation force is 
obtained from 

.. math::

    F_{exc}(t)=\Re\left[ R_{f}(t)\frac{H}{2}F_{exc}(\omega, \theta)e^{i\omega t} \right]

where :math:`\Re` denotes the real part of the formula, :math:`R_{f}` is the 
ramp function, :math:`H` is the wave height, :math:`F_{exc}` is the frequency 
dependent complex wave-excitation amplitude vector, and :math:`\theta` is the 
wave direction. 

The mean drift force has two contributions:

    * 2nd-order hydrodynamic pressure due to the first-order wave 
    * Interaction between the first-order motion and the first-order wave

Currently, WEC-Sim only reads mean drift coefficients representing the first contribution. 
The mean drift force can optionally be included if these coefficients are defined in the BEM data.
The mean drift force is obtained from:

.. math::
    F_{md}(t)=\left(\frac{H}{2}\right)^2F_{md}(\omega,\theta)
    
The mean drift force is combined with the excitation force in the response class output.

.. Note::
    Currently, WEC-Sim only supports mean drift coefficients from WAMIT.

Convolution Integral Formulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the case of an irregular wave spectrum, the fluid memory has an important 
impact on the WEC dynamics. This fluid memory effect is captured by the 
convolution integral formulation based upon the Cummins equation 
:cite:`Cummins1962` is used. The radiation term can be calculated by 

.. math::

    F_{rad}(t)=-A_{\infty}\ddot{X}-\intop_{0}^{t}K_{r}(t-\tau)\dot{X}(\tau)d\tau

where :math:`A_{\infty}` is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency and 
:math:`K_{r}` is the radiation impulse response function. This representation 
also assumes that there is no motion for :math:`t<0`. The radiation impulse 
response function is defined as 

.. math:: 
    K_{r}(t) = \frac{2}{\pi} \intop_{0}^{\infty} B(\omega) cos(\omega t) d\omega

For regular waves, the equation described in the last subsection is used to 
calculate the wave excitation vector. For irregular waves, the free surface 
elevation is constructed from a linear superposition of a number of regular 
wave components. Each regular wave component is extracted from a wave spectrum, 
:math:`S(\omega)`, describing the wave energy distribution over a range of wave 
frequencies, generally characterized by a significant wave height and peak wave 
period. The irregular excitation force can be calculated as the real part of an 
integral term across all wave frequencies as follows 

.. math::

    F_{exc}(t)=\Re\left[ R_{f}(t) \sum_{j=1}^{N}
                         F_{exc}(\omega_{j}, \theta)
                         e^{i(\omega_{j}t+\phi_{j})}
                         \sqrt{2S(\omega_{j})d\omega_{j}} \right]

where :math:`\phi` is the randomized phase angle and :math:`N` is the number of 
frequency bands selected to discretize the wave spectrum. For repeatable 
simulation of an irregular wave field :math:`S(\omega)`, WEC-Sim allows 
specification of :math:`\phi`, refer to the :ref:`user-advanced-features-seeded-phase` 
section. 

Additionally, an excitation force impulse response function is defined 
as 

.. math::

    K_{e}(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \intop_{-\infty}^{\infty}
                                F_{exc}(\omega,\theta)e^{i\omega t} d\omega

The excitation impulse response function is only used for the userDefinedElevation wave case.

State Space
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is highly desirable to represent the radiation convolution integral 
described in the last subsection in state space (SS) form :cite:`Yu1996`. This 
has been shown to dramatically increase computational speeds 
:cite:`Taghipour2008` and allow utilization of conventional control methods 
that rely on linear state space models. An approximation will need to be made 
as :math:`K_{r}` is solved from a set of partial differential equations where 
as a `linear state space` is constructed from a set of ordinary differential 
equations. In general, a linear system is desired such that: 

.. math::

    \dot{X}_{r} \left( t \right) =
        \mathbf{A_{r}} X_{r} \left( t \right) +
        \mathbf{B_{r}} \mathbf{u} (t);~~X_{r}\left( 0 \right) = 0~~ \nonumber \\
    \int_{0}^{t} \mathbf{K_{r}} \left( t- \tau \right) d\tau \approx
        \mathbf{C_{r}} X_{r} \left( t \right) +
        \mathbf{D_{r}} \mathbf{u} \left( t \right)~~

with :math:`\mathbf{A_{r}},~\mathbf{B_{r}},~\mathbf{C_{r}},~\mathbf{D_{r}}` 
being the time-invariant state, input, output, and feed through matrices, while 
:math:`u` is the input to the system and :math:`X_{r}` is the state vector 
describing the convolution kernel as time progresses. 

Calculation of :math:`K_{r}` from State Space Matrices
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The impulse response of a single-input zero-state state-space model is 
represented by 

.. math::

    \dot{x} &= \mathbf{A_{r}} x + \mathbf{B_{r}} u \\
          y &= \mathbf{C_{r}} x

where :math:`u` is an impulse. If the initial state is set to :math:`x(0)= 
\mathbf{B_{r}} u` the response of the unforced (:math:`u=0`) system 


.. math::

    \dot{x} &= \mathbf{A_{r}} x \\
          y &= \mathbf{C_{r}} x

is clearly equivalent to the zero-state impulse response. The impulse response 
of a continuous system with a nonzero :math:`\mathbf{D_r}` matrix is infinite 
at :math:`t=0`; therefore, the lower continuity value 
:math:`\mathbf{C_{r}}\mathbf{B_{r}}` is reported at :math:`t=0`. The general 
solution to a linear time invariant (LTI) system is given by: 

.. math::

    x(t) = e^{\mathbf{A_{r}}t} x(0) +
        \int_{0}^{t} e^{\mathbf{A_{r}}(t-\tau)} \mathbf{B_{r}} u (\tau) d\tau~~

where :math:`e^{\mathbf{A_{r}}}` is the matrix exponential and the calculation 
of :math:`K_{r}` follows: 

.. math::

    K_{r}(t) = \mathbf{C_{r}}e^{\mathbf{A_{r}}t}\mathbf{B_{r}}~~

Realization Theory
""""""""""""""""""

The state space realization of the hydrodynamic radiation coefficients can be 
pursued in the time domain (TD). This consists of finding the minimal order of 
the system and the discrete time state matrices 
(:math:`\mathbf{A_{d}},~\mathbf{B_{d}},~\mathbf{C_{d}},~\mathbf{D_{d}}`) from 
samples of the impulse response function. This problem is easier to handle for 
a discrete-time system than for continuous-time. The reason being is that the 
impulse response function of a discrete-time system is given by the Markov 
parameters of the system: 

.. math::

    \mathbf{\tilde{K}_{r}} \left( t_{k} \right) =
                        \mathbf{C_{d}}\mathbf{A_{d}}^{k}\mathbf{B_{d}}~~

where :math:`t_{k}=k\Delta t` for :math:`k=0,~1,~2,~\ldots` with :math:`\Delta 
t` being the sampling period. The feedthrough matrix :math:`\mathbf{D_d}` is 
assumed to be zero in order to maintain causality of the system, as a non-zero 
:math:`\mathbf{D_d}` results in an infinite value at :math:`t=0`. 

The most common algorithm to obtain the realization is to perform a Singular 
Value Decomposition (SVD) on the Hankel matrix of the impulse response 
function, as proposed by Kung :cite:`Kung1978`. The order of the system and 
state-space parameters are determined from the number of significant singular 
values and the factors of the SVD. The Hankel matrix (:math:`H`) of the impulse 
response function 

.. math::

    H = \begin{bmatrix}
            \mathbf{K_{r}}(2) & \mathbf{K_{r}}(3) & \ldots & \mathbf{K_{r}}(n) \\
            \mathbf{K_{r}}(3) & \mathbf{K_{r}}(4) & \ldots & 0 \\
            \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
            \mathbf{K_{r}}(n) & 0 & \cdots & 0
        \end{bmatrix} &\\ 

can be reproduced exactly by the SVD as

.. math::

    H = \mathbf{U} \Sigma \mathbf{V^{*}}

where :math:`\Sigma` is a diagonal matrix containing the Hankel singular values 
in descending order. Examination of the Hankel singular values reveals there 
are only a small number of significant states and that the rank of :math:`H` 
can be greatly reduced without a significant loss in accuracy 
:cite:`Taghipour2008,Kristiansen2005`. Further detail into the SVD method and 
calculation of the state space parameters will not be discussed here and the 
reader is referred to :cite:`Taghipour2008,Kristiansen2005`. 

Regular Waves
-------------

Regular waves are defined as planar sinusoidal waves, where the incident wave is defined as :math:`\eta(x,y,t)` :

.. math::

    \eta(x,y,t)= \frac{H}{2} \cos( \omega t - k (x\cos \theta + y\sin \theta) + \phi)

where :math:`H` is the wave height, :math:`\omega` is the wave frequency 
(:math:`\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}`), :math:`k` is the wave number (:math:`k = 
\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}`), :math:`\theta` is the wave direction, and :math:`\phi` 
is the wave phase.

Dispersion Relation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For ocean waves, the dispersion relation is a relation between the wave angular frequency and the wave number (i.e. wavelength). 
The dispersion relation is derived using separation of variables to satisfy the free surface kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions. 
For a more detailed derivation please the reader is referred `here <https://web.mit.edu/13.021/demos/lectures/lecture19.pdf>`__ The dispersion relation that WEC-sim uses is defined as: 

.. math::

   \omega^{2} = gk\tanh\left(kh\right) \approx \begin{cases}
   gk & \text{as } kh \rightarrow \infty \\
   gk^{2}h & \text{as } kh \rightarrow 0
   \end{cases}
   
where :math:`\omega` is the wave angular frequency (:math:`\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}`), :math:`g` is gravitational acceleration, 
:math:`k` is the wave number (:math:`k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}`), and :math:`h` is the water depth. The dispersion relation can be 
simplified if the floating body is located in deep water, :math:`h \rightarrow \infty` . The simplifcation comes from the hyperbolic 
tangent function having an asympote of 1 as its argument tends to infinity (:math:`\tanh \left( \infty \right) \rightarrow 1`). 
The deep water condition can still be met if the water depth is not infinite while the following expression holds :math:`kh \geq \pi` . 
The dispersion relation can then be used to derive the phase velocity which refers to the speed that an observer would need to travel for 
the wave to appear stationary (unchanging). The phase velocity of a two-dimensional progressive wave is given by the following expression:

.. math::

   c_{p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}\tanh\left(kh\right)} \approx \begin{cases}
   \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}=\frac{g}{\omega} & \text{as } kh \rightarrow \infty \\
   \sqrt{gh} & \text{as } kh \rightarrow 0
   \end{cases}
   
Regular Wave Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time-averaged power, per unit wave crest with, for a propagating water wave  

.. math::

   P_{w} = \frac{1}{2}\rho g A^{2} c_{g}
   
where :math:`\rho` is the fluid density, :math:`g` is gravitational acceleration, :math:`A` is the wave amplitude, and :math:`c_{g}` is wave group velocity. 
The group velocity is the speed of propagation of a packet of waves which is always slower than the wave phase velocity. For a more detailed derivation on the 
group velocity the reader is referred `here <http://web.mit.edu/2.016/www/handouts/2005Reading7.pdf>`__. The group velocity of a two-dimensional progressive wave
is given by the following expression:

.. math::

   c_{g} = \frac{\delta \omega}{\delta k} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}\tanh\left(kh\right)} \left( 1 + \frac{2kh}{\sinh \left( 2kh \right)} \right)

where :math:`\sinh` is the hyperbolic sine function. The square root term is the phase velocity which can be used to simplify the group velocity expression as follows:

.. math::
   
   c_{g} = \frac{1}{2} c_{p} \left( 1 + \frac{2kh}{\sinh \left( 2kh \right)} \right) \approx \begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{2} c_{p} & \text{as } kh \rightarrow \infty \\
   1 	             & \text{as } kh \rightarrow 0
   \end{cases}

Inserting the full expression for the group velocity into the wave power equation provides the following:

.. math::

   P_{w} = \frac{1}{4}\rho g A^{2} \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}\tanh\left(kh\right)} \left[ 1 + \frac{2kh}{\sinh \left( 2kh \right)} \right]
   
Similar to the other wave property expressions, the wave power expression can be simplified for both deep and shallow water conditions as follows:

.. math::

   P_{w} \approx 
   \begin{cases}
   \frac{1}{4}\rho g A^{2} \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}} = \frac{1}{8\pi}\rho g^{2} A^{2} T & \text{as } kh \rightarrow \infty \\
   \frac{1}{4}\rho g A^{2} \sqrt{gh} 	             & \text{as } kh \rightarrow 0
   \end{cases}
   
.. Note:: 
    The deep water condition is often used without proper validation of the wave environment which can have a significant effect on wave power. 
    WEC-Sim by default will calculate the wave power using the full expression, no simplification, unless the hydrodynamic data is imported with 
    the assumption of infinite water depth. 

Irregular Waves
----------------

Irregular waves are modeled as the linear superposition of a large number of 
harmonic waves at different frequencies and angles of incidence, where the 
incident wave is defined as :math:`\eta(x,y,t)` : 

.. math::

    \eta(x,y,t) = \sum_{i} \frac{H_{i}}{2} \cos( \omega_{i} t - 
                    k_{i} (x\cos \theta_{i} + y \sin \theta_{i}) + \phi_{i})

where :math:`H` is the wave height, :math:`\omega` is the wave frequency 
(:math:`\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}`), :math:`k` is the wave number (:math:`k = 
\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}`), :math:`\theta` is the wave direction, and :math:`\phi` 
is the wave phase (randomized for irregular waves). 

.. _theory-wave-spectra:

Wave Spectra
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The linear superposition of regular waves of distinct amplitudes and periods is 
characterized in the frequency domain by a wave spectrum. Through statistical 
analysis, spectra are characterized by specific parameters such as significant 
wave height, peak period, wind speed, fetch length, and others. Common types of 
wave spectra that are used by the offshore industry are discussed in the 
following sections. The general form of the wave spectra available in WEC-Sim 
is given by: 

.. math::

    S\left( f , \theta \right)= S\left( f \right)D\left( \theta \right)~~

where :math:`S\left( f\right)` is the wave power spectrum, :math:`f` is the 
wave frequency (in Hertz), :math:`D\left( \theta \right)` is the directional 
distribution, and :math:`\theta` is the wave direction (in Degrees). The 
formulation of :math:`D\left( \theta \right)` requires that 

.. math::

    \int_{0}^{\infty} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi}
        S \left( f \right) D \left( \theta \right) d\theta df =
                                    \int_{0}^{\infty} S\left( f \right) df

so that the total energy in the directional spectrum must be the same as the 
total energy in the one-dimensional spectrum. 

.. math::

    S\left( f \right) = A_{ws} f^{-5}\exp\left[-B_{ws} f^{-4} \right]~~

where :math:`A_{ws}` and :math:`B_{ws}` are coefficients that vary depending on 
the wave spectrum and :math:`\exp` stands for the exponential function. 
Spectral moments of the wave spectrum, denoted :math:`m_{k}~,~k=0, 1, 2,...`, 
are defined as 

.. math::
    m_{k} = \int_{0}^{\infty} f^{k} S \left( f \right) df ~~

The spectral moment, :math:`m_{0}` is the variance of the free surface which 
allows one to define the mean wave height of the tallest third of waves, 
significant wave height :math:`H_{m0}` (in m), as: 

.. math::
    H_{m0} = 4 \sqrt{m_{0}}~~
    
Irregular Wave Power
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The time-averaged wave power available for a given irregular sea state can be calcuated from:

.. math::
    P_{w} = \rho g \int_{0}^{\infty} S \left( f \right) c_{g} \left( f \right) df

where the expression for group velocity for regular waves can be inserted for each frequency used
to describe the sea spectrum.



Pierson--Moskowitz (PM) Spectrum
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The PM spectrum is applicable to a fully developed sea, when the growth of the 
waves is not limited by the fetch :cite:`PM`. The two-parameter PM spectrum is 
based on a significant wave height and peak wave frequency. For a given 
significant wave height, the peak frequency can be varied to cover a range of 
conditions including developing and decaying seas. In general, the parameters 
depend strongly on wind speed, and also wind direction, fetch, and locations of 
storm fronts. The spectral density of the surface elevation defined by the PM 
spectrum :cite:`IEC-2` is defined by: 

.. math::

    S_{PM}\left( f \right) = \frac{{H_{m0}}^2}{4}
     \left( 1.057f_{p} \right)^{4} f^{-5} \exp
        \left[-\frac{5}{4} \left( \frac{f_{p}}{f}\right)^{4} \right]

This implies coefficients of the general form:

.. math::

    A_{ws} &= \frac{{H_{m0}}^2}{4}\left(1.057f_{p}\right)^{4} \approx
        \frac{5}{16} {H_{m0}}^2 {f_{p}}^{4} \approx \frac{B_{ws}}{4}{H_{m0}}^2 \\ 
    B_{ws} &= \left(1.057f_{p}\right)^{4} \approx \frac{5}{4}{f_{p}}^{4}

where :math:`H_{m0}` is the significant wave height, :math:`f_{p}` is the peak 
wave frequency :math:`\left(=1/T_{p}\right)`, and :math:`f` is the wave 
frequency. 

JONSWAP (JS) Spectrum
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The JONSWAP (Joint North Sea Wave Project) spectrum is formulated as a 
modification of the PM spectrum for developing sea sate in a fetch-limited 
situation :cite:`HK`. The spectrum accounts for a higher peak and a narrower 
spectrum in a storm situation for the same total energy as compared to the PM 
spectrum. The spectral density of the surface elevation defined by the JS 
spectrum :cite:`IEC-2` is defined by: 

.. math::

    S_{JS}\left( f \right) = C_{ws} \left(\gamma\right) S_{PM} \gamma^{\alpha}

where :math:`\gamma` is the nondimensional peak-shape parameter.

The normalizing factor, :math:`C_{ws}\left(\gamma\right)`, is defined as: 

.. math:: 

    C_{ws}\left(\gamma\right) = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty} S_{PM}\left( f \right)df}
        {\int_{0}^{\infty}S_{PM}\left(f\right)\gamma^{\alpha}df} =
                                                1 -0.287\ln\left(\gamma\right)

The peak-shape parameter exponent :math:`\alpha` is defined as:

.. math::

    \alpha = \exp \left[ -\left( \frac{\frac{f}{f_{p}}-1}{\sqrt{2} \sigma}\right)^{2} \right],~~
    \sigma = \begin{cases} 0.07 & f \leq f_{p} \\0.09 & f > f_{p} \end{cases} ~~

The peak-shape parameter is defined based on the following relationship between 
the significant wave height, :math:`H_{m0}`, and peak period, :math:`T_{p}`: 

.. math:: 

    \gamma = \begin{cases} 
        5                                                        & \text{for } \frac{T_{p}}{\sqrt{H_{m0}}} \leq 3.6        \\
        \exp\left(5.75 - 1.15\frac{T_{p}}{\sqrt{H_{m0}}} \right) & \text{for } 3.6 \leq \frac{T_{p}}{\sqrt{H_{m0}}} \leq 5 \\
        1                                                        & \text{for } \frac{T_{p}}{\sqrt{H_{m0}}} > 5
    \end{cases}
    
with general form coefficients thus defined:

.. math::
    A_{ws} &= \frac{B_{ws}}{4}{H_{m0}}^2 C_{ws}\left(\gamma \right) \gamma^{\alpha} \\
    B_{ws} &= \frac{5}{4}{f_{p}}^{4}

Ocean Current
-------------

An ocean current is a continuous, directed movement of sea water generated by a number of forces acting upon the water, including wind, 
the Coriolis effect, breaking waves, cabbeling, temperature and salinity differences, and other ocean phenomena. Depth contours, shoreline configurations, and 
interactions with other currents influence a current's direction and strength. Ocean current can vary in space and time, but are generally modeled assuming a 
horizontally uniform flow field of constant velocity and direction, varying only as a function of depth.

    ..

    *Ocean Current Profiles Within WEC-Sim*
    
Within WEC-Sim there are three options to model ocean currents: 

Option 1
^^^^^^^^

In Option 1, the sub-surface current is depth independent and is equal to the current at the water surface:

.. math::
   \vec{U}_{ss,current}(z) = U_{ss,current}(0)\left[ \cos \left(\theta_{c} \right) \hat{i} + \sin \left(\theta_{c} \right) \hat{j} \right]
   
where :math:`\theta_{c}` is the current direction.
    
Option 2
^^^^^^^^
    
In Option 2, the sub-surface current profile varies with depth following a 1/7th power law:
    
.. math::
   \vec{U}_{ss,current}(z) = U_{ss,current}(0)\left[ 1 + \frac{z}{d_{current}} \right]^{1/7} \left[ \cos \left(\theta_{c}\right) \hat{i} + \sin \left(\theta_{c} \right) \hat{j} \right]
   
where :math:`d_{current}` is the water depth where the sub-surface current is 0.

Option 3
^^^^^^^^
    
In Option 3, the sub-surface current profile varies linearly with depth:
    
.. math::
   \vec{U}_{ss,current}(z) = U_{ss,current}(0)\left[ 1 + \frac{z}{d_{current}} \right] \left[ \cos \left(\theta_{c} \right) \hat{i} + \sin \left(\theta_{c} \right) \hat{j} \right]

.. Note:: 
    WEC-Sim does not adjust the linear wave hydrodynamics based on the presence 
    of ocean currents and assumes a linear superposition between current and
    wave forces. The ocean current option is used only in the Morison Element
    force calculation. 

Power Take-Off (PTO)
--------------------

Throughout the following sections, unless specification is made between linear 
and rotary PTOs, units are not explicitly stated. 

Linear PTO
^^^^^^^^^^

The PTO mechanism is represented as a linear spring-damper system where the 
reaction force is given by: 

.. math::

    F_{pto}=-K{}_{pto}X_{rel}-C_{pto}\dot{X}_{rel}

where :math:`K_{pto}` is the stiffness of the PTO, :math:`C_{pto}` is the 
damping of the PTO, and :math:`X_{rel}` and :math:`\dot{X}_{rel}` are the 
relative motion and velocity between two bodies. The instantaneous power 
absorbed by the PTO is given by: 

.. math::

    P_{pto} = -F_{pto}\dot{X}_{rel} = \left(K_{pto}X_{rel} \dot{X}_{rel} + 
                                        C_{pto} \dot{X}^{2}_{rel} \right)

Hydraulic PTO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PTO mechanism is modeled as a hydraulic system :cite:`So`, where the 
reaction force is given by: 

.. math::

    F_{pto}=\Delta{} p_{piston}A_{piston}

where :math:`\Delta{} p_{piston}` is the differential pressure of the hydraulic 
piston and :math:`A_{piston}` is the piston area. The instantaneous hydraulic 
power absorbed by the PTO is given by: 

.. math::

    P_{pto}=-F_{pto}\dot{X}_{rel}


Mechanical PTO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PTO mechanism is modeled as a direct-drive linear generator system 
:cite:`So`, where the reaction force is given by: 

.. math::

    F_{pto}=(\frac{\pi}{\tau_{pm}})\lambda_{fd}i_{sq}

where :math:`\tau_{pm}` is the magnet pole pitch (the center-to-center distance 
of adjacent magnetic poles), :math:`\lambda_{fd}` is the flux linkage of the 
stator :math:`d`-axis winding due to flux produced by the rotor magnets, and 
:math:`i_{sq}` is the stator :math:`q`-axis current. The instantaneous 
mechanical power absorbed by the PTO is given by: 

.. math::

    P_{pto}=-F_{pto}\dot{X}_{rel}

For more information about application of pto systems in WEC-Sim, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-pto` section. 

Mooring 
-------

The mooring load is represented using a linear quasi-static mooring stiffness 
or by using the mooring forces calculated from `MoorDyn 
<http://www.matt-hall.ca/moordyn>`_ :cite:`Hall2015MoorDynGuide`, which is an 
open-source lumped-mass mooring dynamics model. 

Mooring Matrix
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When linear quasi-static mooring stiffness is used, the mooring load can be 
calculated by 

.. math::
    F_{m}=-K_{m}X-C_{m}\dot{X}

where :math:`K_{m}` and :math:`C_{m}` are the stiffness and damping matrices 
for the mooring system, and :math:`X` and :math:`\dot{X}` are the displacement 
and velocity of the body, respectively. 

MoorDyn
^^^^^^^

MoorDyn discretizes each mooring line in a mooring system into evenly-sized 
line segments connected by node points (see :ref:`MoorDyn figure 
<MoorDynFig>`). The line mass is lumped at these node points along with 
gravitational and buoyancy forces, hydrodynamic loads, and reactions from 
contact with the seabed. Hydrodynamic drag and added mass are calculated based 
on Morison's equation. A mooring line's axial stiffness is modeled by applying 
a linear stiffness to each line segment in tension only. A damping term is also 
applied in each segment to dampen non-physical resonance caused by the 
lumped-mass discretization. Bending and torsional stiffnesses are neglected. 
Bottom contact is represented by vertical stiffness and damping forces applied 
at the nodes when a node is located below the seabed.

Nonlinear Buoyancy and Froude-Krylov Wave Excitation
-----------------------------------------------------

The linear model assumes that the body motion and the waves consist of small 
amplitudes in comparison to the wavelengths. A weakly nonlinear approach is 
applied to account for the nonlinear hydrodynamic forces induced by the 
instantaneous water surface elevation and body position. Rather than using the 
BEM calculated linear wave-excitation and hydrostatic coefficients, the 
nonlinear buoyancy and the Froude-Krylov force components can be obtained by 
integrating the static and dynamic pressures over each panel along the wetted 
body surface at each time step. Linear wave theory is used to determine the 
flow velocity and pressure field, so the values become unrealistically large 
for wetted panels that are above the mean water level. To correct this, the 
Wheeler stretching method is applied :cite:`wheeler1969methods`, which applies 
a correction to the instantaneous wave elevation that forces its height to be 
equal to the water depth when calculating the flow velocity and pressure, 

 .. math::
    z^* = \frac{D(D+z)}{(D+\eta)} - D

where :math:`D` is the mean water depth, and :math:`\eta` is the z-value on the 
instantaneous water surface. 

.. Note:: 
    The nonlinear WEC-Sim method is not intended to model highly nonlinear hydrodynamic events, such as wave slamming and wave breaking. 

For more information about application of nonlinear hydrodynamics in WEC-Sim, 
refer to :ref:`user-advanced-features-nonlinear` section. 

.. _theory-viscous-damping-morison:

Viscous Damping and Morison Elements
------------------------------------

Additional damping and added-mass can be added to the WEC system. This 
facilitates experimental validation of the WEC-Sim code, particularly in the 
event that the BEM hydrodynamic outputs are not sufficiently representative of 
the physical system. 

Viscous Damping
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linear damping and quadratic drag forces add flexibility to the definition of viscous forcing

 .. math::
    F_{v} &= -C_{v}\dot{X}-\frac{C_{d} \rho A_{d}}{2}\dot{X}|\dot{X}| \\
          &= -C_{v}\dot{X}-C_{D}\dot{X}|\dot{X}| 

where :math:`C_{v}` is the linear (viscous) damping coefficient, :math:`C_{d}` 
is the quadratic drag coefficient, :math:`\rho` is the fluid density, and 
:math:`A_{d}` is the characteristic area for drag calculation. Alternatively, 
one can define :math:`C_{D}` directly. 

Because BEM codes are potential flow solvers and neglect the effects of 
viscosity, :math:`F_{v}` generally must be included to accurately model device 
performance. However, it can be difficult to select representative drag 
coefficients, as they depend on device geometry, scale, and relative velocity 
between the body and the flow around it. Empirical data on the drag coefficient 
can be found in various literature and standards, but is generally limited to 
simple geometries evaluated at a limited number of scales and flow conditions. 
For realistic device geometries, the use of computational fluid dynamic 
simulations or experimental data is encouraged. 

Morison Elements 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Morison Equation assumes that the fluid forces in an oscillating flow on a 
structure of slender cylinders or other similar geometries arise partly from 
pressure effects from potential flow and partly from viscous effects. A slender 
cylinder implies that the diameter, D, is small relative to the wave length, 
:math:`\lambda`, which is generally met when :math:`D/\lambda < 0.1 - 0.2`. If 
this condition is not met, wave diffraction effects must be taken into account. 
Assuming that the geometries are slender, the resulting force can be 
approximated by a modified Morison formulation :cite:`Morison1950`. The 
formulation for each element on the body can be given as 

 .. math::
    F_{me}=\rho\forall\dot{v} + \rho\forall C_{a}(\dot{v}-\ddot{X}) + 
                        \frac{C_{d}\rho A_{d}}{2}(v-\dot{X})|v-\dot{X}|

where :math:`v` is the fluid particle velocity due to the wave and current speed, 
:math:`C_{a}` is the coefficient of added mass, and :math:`\forall` is the 
displaced volume. 

.. Note:: 
    WEC-Sim  does not consider buoyancy effects when calculating the forces 
    from Morison elements. 

For more information about application of Morison Elements in WEC-Sim, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-morison` section. 


Generalized Body Modes 
----------------------

Additional generalized body modes (GBM) are included to account for solving a 
multibody system with relative body motions, dynamics, or structural 
deformation. This implementation assumes the modal properties are given, 
obtainable in closed-form expressions or with finite element analysis. Once the 
hydrodynamic coefficients that include these additional flexible DOF are 
obtained from the BEM solver, the 6DOF rigid body motion for each body and the 
additional GBM DOFs are solved together in one system of equations. See this 
example and :ref:`user-advanced-features` for more details on implementing GBM.
