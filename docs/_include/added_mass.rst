.. _dev-added-mass:

Added mass is a special multi-directional fluid dynamic phenomenon that most
physics software cannot account for well. WEC-Sim uses a special added mass 
treatment to get around the current limitations of Simscape Multibody. For the 
most robust simulation, the added mass matrix should be combined with the mass 
and inertia, shown in the manipulation of the governing equation below: 

.. math::

    m\ddot{X_i} &= \Sigma F(t,\omega) - A\ddot{X_i} \\
    (m+A)\ddot{X_i} &= \Sigma F(t,\omega) \\
    M_{adjusted}\ddot{X_i} &= \Sigma F(t,\omega)

where :math:`m` is the mass, :math:`I` is the moment of inertia, :math:`A` is the added mass, and subscript :math:`i` represents the timestep being solved for. 
In this case, the mass of a body is set to the sum of the translational mass, rotational inertia and the added mass matrix:

.. math::

    M_{adjusted} = \begin{bmatrix}
                       m + A_{1,1} & A_{1,2} & A_{1,3} & A_{1,4} & A_{1,5} & A_{1,6} \\
                       A_{2,1} & m + A_{2,2} & A_{2,3} & A_{2,4} & A_{2,5} & A_{2,6} \\
                       A_{3,1} & A_{3,2} & m + A_{3,3} & A_{3,4} & A_{3,5} & A_{3,6} \\
                       A_{4,1} & A_{4,2} & A_{4,3} & I_{4,4} + A_{4,4} & A_{4,5} & A_{4,6} \\
                       A_{5,1} & A_{5,2} & A_{5,3} & A_{5,4} & I_{5,5} + A_{5,5} & A_{5,6} \\
                       A_{6,1} & A_{6,2} & A_{6,3} & A_{6,4} & A_{6,5} & I_{6,6} + A_{6,6} \\
                   \end{bmatrix}

This formulation is ideal because it removes the acceleration dependence from the right hand side of the equation. 
Without this treatment, the acceleration creates an unsolvable algebraic loop. 
There are ways to get around this issue, but simulation robustness and stability become more difficult.

The core issue with this combined mass formulation is that Simscape does not allow a generic body to have a degree-of-freedom specific mass.
A Simscape body is only allowed to have one translational mass and three values of inertia about each translational axis. 

Due to this limitation, WEC-Sim cannot combine the mass and added mass on the left-hand side of the equation of motion (as shown above). 
Instead, WEC-Sim moves some components of added mass, while the majority of the components remain on the right-hand side. 
There is a 1-1 mapping between rotational inertia and the roll-roll (4,4), pitch-pitch (5,5), yaw-yaw (6,6) added mass components. 
Additionally, some combination of the surge-surge (1,1), sway-sway (2,2), heave-heave (3,3) components correspond to the translational mass of the body. Therefore, WEC-Sim treats the added mass in the following way:

.. math::

    M_{adjusted} &= m + \alpha Y \\

where 

.. math::
    Y &= (A_{1,1} + A_{2,2} + A_{3,3}) \\

and

.. math::

    I_{adjusted} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                       I_{4,4} + A_{4,4} \\
                       I_{5,5} + A_{5,5} \\
                       I_{6,6} + A_{6,6} \\
                   \end{bmatrix} \\
    A_{adjusted} &= \begin{bmatrix}
                       A_{1,1} - \alpha Y & A_{1,2} & A_{1,3} & A_{1,4} & A_{1,5} & A_{1,6} \\
                       A_{2,1} & A_{2,2} - \alpha Y & A_{2,3} & A_{2,4} & A_{2,5} & A_{2,6} \\
                       A_{3,1} & A_{3,2} & A_{3,3} - \alpha Y & A_{3,4} & A_{3,5} & A_{3,6} \\
                       A_{4,1} & A_{4,2} & A_{4,3} & 0 & A_{4,5} & A_{4,6} \\
                       A_{5,1} & A_{5,2} & A_{5,3} & A_{5,4} & 0 & A_{5,6} \\
                       A_{6,1} & A_{6,2} & A_{6,3} & A_{6,4} & A_{6,5} & 0\\
                   \end{bmatrix}

The factor :math:`\alpha` represents ``simu.adjMassFactor =2``, the default value.

The summation of the adjusted mass, inertia and added mass is identical to the original summation above. 
The governing equation of motion does not change, only its implementation. 
A simulation class weight factor controls the degree to which the added mass is adjusted to create the most robust simulation possible. 
To see its effects, set ``simu.adjMassFactor = 0`` and WEC-Sim will likely become unstable.

However WEC-Sim again contains an unsolvable algebraic loop due to the acceleration dependence. 
WEC-Sim removes this algebraic problem using a `Simulink Transport Delay <https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/transportdelay.html>`_ with a very small time delay (``1e-8``). 
This typically results in using the acceleration at a previous time step to calculate the added mass force. 
However, since the time delay is smaller than the simulation time step Simulink will extrapolate the previous step to within 1e-8 of the current time step. 
This will convert the algebraic loop equation of motion to a solvable one:

.. math::

    M_{adjusted}\ddot{X_i} &= \Sigma F(t,\omega) - A_{adjusted}\ddot{X}_{i - (10^{-8}/dt)} \\

The acceleration used for the added mass represents the previous time step (:math:`i-1`) interpolated to ``1e-8`` seconds before the current time step being solved. 
This can be thought of as a ``i-0.001%`` time step; a close approximation of the current time step.

.. Note::
	Depending on the wave formulation used, :math:`A` can either be a function of wave frequency :math:`A(\omega)`, or equal to the added mass at infinite wave frequency :math:`A_{\infty}`
