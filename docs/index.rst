WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) 
#########################################

`WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim>`_ is an open-source code for simulating wave energy converters. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver Simscape Multibody. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of bodies, joints, power take-off systems, and mooring systems. WEC-Sim can model both rigid bodies and flexible bodies with generalized body modes. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing wave energy converter equations of motion in the 6 Cartesian degrees-of-freedom, plus any number of user-defined modes. The `WEC-Sim Applications repository <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim_Applications>`_ contains a wide variety of scenarios that WEC-Sim can be used to model, including desalination, mooring dynamics, nonlinear hydrodynamic bodies, passive yawing, batch simulations and many others. The code is very flexible and can be adapted to many scenarios within the wave energy industry.
