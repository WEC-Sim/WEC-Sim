WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) 
#########################################

`WEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter SIMulator) <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim>`_ 
is an open-source software for simulating wave energy converters. The software is 
developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver Simscape 
Multibody. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of 
bodies, joints, power take-off systems, and mooring systems. WEC-Sim can model 
both rigid bodies and flexible bodies with generalized body modes. Simulations 
are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing wave energy converter 
equations of motion in the 6 Cartesian degrees-of-freedom, plus any number of 
user-defined modes. The `WEC-Sim Applications repository 
<https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim_Applications>`_ contains a wide variety of 
scenarios that WEC-Sim can be used to model, including desalination, mooring 
dynamics, nonlinear hydrodynamic bodies, passive yawing, batch simulations and 
many others. The software is very flexible and can be adapted to many scenarios 
within the wave energy industry.

WEC-Sim Developers
=====================
WEC-Sim is a collaboration between the `National Renewable Energy Laboratory 
(NREL) <http://www.nrel.gov/water/>`_ and `Sandia National Laboratories 
(Sandia) <http://energy.sandia.gov/energy/renewable-energy/water-power/>`_, 
funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office.
Due to the open source nature of the software, WEC-Sim has also had many external 
contributions.
