Code Structure
==============

This section provides a description of the WEC-Sim source code and its 
structure. For more information about WEC-Sim's code structure, refer to the 
:ref:`user-webinars-code-structure` webinar. 

.. _user-code-structure-src:

WEC-Sim Source Code
-------------------

The directory where the WEC-Sim code is contained is referred to as ``$WECSIM`` 
(e.g. ``C:/User/Documents/GitHub/WEC-Sim``). The WEC-Sim source code files are 
contained within a source directory referred to as ``$WECSIM/source``. The 
WEC-Sim source code consists primarily of three components as described in the table:

=========================   ====================  ============================
**File Type**               **File name**         **Directory**               
WEC-Sim Executable          ``wecSim.m``          ``$WECSIM/source``          
WEC-Sim MATLAB Functions    ``<functionName>.m``  ``$WECSIM/source/functions``
WEC-Sim MATLAB Classes      ``<objectClass>.m``   ``$WECSIM/source/objects``  
WEC-Sim Simulink Library    ``WECSim_Lib.slx``    ``$WECSIM/source/lib``      
=========================   ====================  ============================

The WEC-Sim executable is the ``wecSim.m`` file.
Executing ``wecSim`` from a case directory parses the user input data, 
performs pre-processing calculations in each of the classes, selects and 
initializes variant subsystems in the Simulink model, runs the time-domain 
simulations in WEC-Sim, and calls post-processing scripts. 
When a WEC-Sim case is properly set-up, the user only needs to use the single command ``wecSim`` 
in the command line to run the simulation.

Users can run WEC-Sim from the command line with the command ``wecSim`` or from directly from Simulink,
refer to :ref:`user-advanced-features-simulink`.


.. _user-code-structure-classes:

WEC-Sim Classes
---------------

All information required to run WEC-Sim simulations is contained within the 
``simu``, ``waves``, ``body(i)``, ``constraint(i)``, ``pto(i)``, ``cable(i)``, and 
``mooring(i)`` objects (instances of the simulationClass, waveClass, bodyClass, 
constraintClass, ptoClass, cableClass, and mooringClass). 
Users can instantiate and interact with these classes within the WEC-Sim input
file (``wecSimInputFile.m``). The following :ref:`user-code-structure-source-details`
section describes the role of the WEC-Sim objects, and how to and interact with the
WEC-Sim objects to define input properties. 

There are two ways to look at the available properties and methods within a 
class. The first is to type ``doc <className>`` in Matlab Command Window, and 
the second is to open the class definitions located in the 
``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing ``open <className>`` in MATLAB 
Command Window. The latter provides more information since it also defines the 
different fields in a structure.


.. _user-code-structure-library:

WEC-Sim Library
---------------

In addition to the ``wecSimInputFile.m`` that instantiates classes, a WEC-Sim 
simulation requires a simulink model (``*.slx``) that represents the WEC 
system components and their connectivity. Similar to how the input file uses the 
WEC-Sim classes, the Simulink model uses WEC-Sim library blocks. There should 
be a one-to-one relationship between the objects defined in the input file and
the blocks used in the Simulink model. 

The WEC-Sim library is divided different types of library blocks. 
Users should be able to model their WEC device using the available WEC-Sim 
blocks (and possibly other Simulink/Simscape blocks). The image below shows the 
WEC-Sim block grouping by type. 

.. figure:: /_static/images/WEC-Sim_Lib.PNG

The following sections describe the different library types, the related class, and their general 
purpose. 

.. _user-code-structure-source-details:

Source Details
--------------
The WEC-Sim Classes and Library Blocks interact with one another during a simulation.
The classes contain functions for initialization, reading input data, pre-processing and post-processing.
The library blocks use these pre-processed parameters during the time-domain simulation in Simulink.
The relationship between WEC-Sim Classes and their corresponding Library Blocks are described in the following sections, and summarized in the table below. 

======================================= =====================================
**WEC-Sim Classes**    			**Corresponding Library Blocks**
Simulation Class and Wave Class		Frames 
Body Class            			Body Elements 
Constraint Class      			Constraints 
PTO Class             			PTOs 
Cable Class           			Cables
Mooring Class         			Moorings 
======================================= =====================================

.. _user-code-structure-simulation-class:

Simulation Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The simulation class contains the simulation parameters, flags and solver 
settings necessary to execute the WEC-Sim code. These simulation parameters 
include numerical settings such as the time step, start time, differential 
equation solver method, and flags for various output options and nonlinear 
hydrodynamics options. At a high level, the simulation class interacts with the 
rest of WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below. The most common flags and 
attributes that are passed to other objects are the start, end, and ramp times,
time steps, global variables (gravity, density, etc). 

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/simulation_diagram.png
   :width: 100%

Simulation Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users 
must initialize the simulation class (``simulationClass``) and specify the name 
of the WEC-Sim (``*.slx``) model file by including the following lines:: 

    simu=simulationClass();
    simu.simMechanicsFile='<modelFile>.slx'

All simulation class properties are specified as variables within the ``simu``
object as members of the ``simulationClass``.
The WEC-Sim code has default values defined for the simulation class 
properties. These default values can be overwritten by the user in the input file,
for example, the end time of a simulation can be set by entering the following command: 
``simu.endTime = <user specified end time>``. 

Users may specify other simulation class properties using the ``simu`` object 
in the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, such as: 

===================== ==================
Simulation start time ``simu.startTime``
End time              ``simu.endTime``  
Ramp time             ``simu.rampTime`` 
Time step             ``simu.dt``       
===================== ================== 

Available simulation properties, default values, and functions can be found by 
typing ``doc simulationClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or by opening the 
``simulationClass.m`` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing ``open 
simulationClass`` in MATLAB Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's simulation class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-simulation`. 

Frame Block
""""""""""""""

The simulation class is tied to the Frames library.
The Frames library contains one block that is necessary in every model. The 
``Global Reference Frame`` block defines the global coordinates, solver 
configuration, seabed and free surface description, simulation time, and other 
global settings. It can be useful to think of the Global Reference Frame as 
being the seabed when creating a model. Every model requires one instance of 
the Global Reference Frame block. The ``Global Reference Frame`` block uses the 
simulation class variable `simu` and the wave class variable `waves`, which 
must be defined in the input file.

.. _user-code-structure-wave-class:

Wave Class
^^^^^^^^^^

The wave class contains all wave information necessary to define the incident 
wave condition for the WEC-Sim time-domain simulation. The wave class contains 
the incoming wave information that determines the excitation 
force, added mass, radiation damping and other frequency based parameters that 
influence a body's motion. 

At a high level, the wave class interacts with the rest of WEC-Sim as shown in 
the diagram below. The wave primarily interacts with the body class 
through the pre-processing of wave forces and in Simulink.

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/wave_diagram.PNG
   :width: 100%

Wave Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users 
must initialize the wave class (``waveClass``) and specify the ``waveType`` by 
including the following line::

	waves = waveClass('<waveType>');

Users must specify additional wave class properties using the ``waves`` object 
depending on which wave type is selected, as shown in the table below. A more 
detailed description of the available wave types is given in the following 
sections. 

=================== ==================================================================
**Wave Type**       **Required Properties**                         
``noWave``          ``waves.period``                                     
``noWaveCIC``                                                      
``regular``         ``waves.height``, ``waves.period``                        
``regularCIC``      ``waves.height``, ``waves.period``                        
``irregular``       ``waves.height``, ``waves.period``, ``waves.spectrumType``

``elevationImport`` ``waves.elevationFile``                           
=================== ==================================================================

Available wave class properties, default values, and functions can be found by 
typing ``doc waveClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or by opening the 
``waveClass.m`` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing ``open 
waveClass`` in the Matlab Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's wave class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-wave`. 


noWave
""""""

The ``noWave`` case is for running WEC-Sim simulations with no waves and 
constant radiation added mass and wave damping coefficients. The ``noWave`` 
case is typically used to run decay tests. Users must still provide hydro 
coefficients from a BEM solver before executing WEC-Sim and specify the period 
(``wave.T``) from which the hydrodynamic coefficients are selected. 

The ``noWave`` case is defined by including the following in the input file::

    waves = waveClass('noWave');
    waves.period = <wavePeriod>; %[s]

noWaveCIC
"""""""""

The ``noWaveCIC`` case is the same as the noWave case described above, but with 
the addition of the convolution integral calculation. The only difference is 
that the radiation forces are calculated using the convolution integral and the 
infinite frequency added mass. 

The ``noWaveCIC`` case is defined by including the following in the input file::

    waves = waveClass('noWaveCIC');

regular
"""""""

The ``regular`` wave case is used for running simulations in regular waves with 
constant radiation added mass and wave damping coefficients. Using this option, 
WEC-Sim assumes that the system dynamic response is in sinusoidal steady-state 
form, where constant added mass and damping coefficients are used (instead of 
the convolution integral) to calculate wave radiation forces. Wave period 
(``wave.T``) and wave height (``wave.H``) must be specified in the input file. 

The ``regular`` case is defined by including the following in the input file::

    waves = waveClass('regular');
    waves.period = <wavePeriod>; %[s]
    waves.height = <waveHeight>; %[m]

regularCIC
""""""""""

The ``regularCIC`` is the same as regular wave case described above, but with 
the addition of the convolution integral calculation. The only difference is 
that the radiation forces are calculated using the convolution integral and the 
infinite frequency added mass. Wave period (``wave.T``) and wave height 
(``wave.H``) must be specified in the input file. 

The ``regularCIC`` case is defined by including the following in the input file::

    waves = waveClass('regularCIC');
    waves.period = <wavePeriod>; %[s]
    waves.height = <waveHeight>; %[m]

.. _user-code-structure-irregular:

irregular
"""""""""

The ``irregular`` wave case is the wave type for irregular wave simulations 
using a Pierson Moskowitz (PM) or JONSWAP (JS) wave spectrum as defined by the 
IEC TS 62600-2:2019 standards. Significant wave height (``wave.H``), peak 
period (``wave.T``), and wave spectrum type (``waves.spectrumtype``) must be 
specified in the input file. The available wave spectra and their corresponding 
``waves.spectrumType`` are listed below: 

======================  ==================
**Wave Spectrum**       **spectrumType**
Pierson Moskowitz       ``PM``
JONSWAP                 ``JS``
======================  ==================

The ``irregular`` case is defined by including the following in the input file::

    waves = waveClass('irregular');
    waves.period = <wavePeriod>; %[s]
    waves.height = <waveHeight>; %[m]
    waves.spectrumType = '<waveSpectrum>';

When using the JONSWAP spectrum, users have the option of defining gamma by 
specifying ``waves.gamma = <waveGamma>;``. If gamma is not defined, 
then gamma is calculated based on a relationship between significant wave 
height and peak period defined by IEC TS 62600-2:2019. 

spectrumImport
""""""""""""""

The ``spectrumImport`` case is the wave type for irregular wave simulations 
using an imported wave spectrum (ex: from buoy data). The user-defined spectrum 
must be defined with the wave frequency (Hz) in the first column, and the 
spectral energy density (m^2/Hz) in the second column. Users have the option to 
specify a third column with phase (rad); if phase is not specified by the user 
it will be randomly defined. An example file is provided in the 
``$WECSIM/examples/*/spectrumData.mat`` directory. The ``spectrumImport`` case is defined by including the following 
in the input file:: 

    waves = waveClass('spectrumImport');
    waves.spectrumFile ='<spectrumFile >.mat';

.. Note::
    When using the ``spectrumImport`` option, users must specify a sufficient 
    number of wave frequencies (typically ~1000) to adequately describe the 
    wave spectra. These wave frequencies are the same that will be used to 
    define the wave forces on the WEC, for more information refer to the 
    :ref:`user-advanced-features-irregular-wave-binning` section.

elevationImport
"""""""""""""""

The ``elevationImport`` case is the wave type for wave simulations using user-defined 
time-series (ex: from experiments). The user-defined wave surface elevation 
must be defined with the time (s) in the first column, and the wave surface 
elevation (m) in the second column. An example of this is given in the 
``etaData.mat`` file in the tutorials directory folder of the WEC-Sim source 
code. The ``elevationImport`` case is defined by including the following in the input 
file:: 

    waves = waveClass('elevationImport');
    waves.elevationFile ='<elevationFile>.mat';



.. _user-code-structure-body-class:

Body Class
^^^^^^^^^^

The body class represents each rigid or flexible body that comprises the WEC 
being simulated. It contains the mass and hydrodynamic properties of each body, 
defined by hydrodynamic data from the ``*.h5`` file. The corresponding body block 
uses the hydrodynamic data and wave class to calculate all relevant forces on 
the body and solve for its resultant motion. At a high level, the body class 
interacts with the rest of WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below. 
Bodies hold hydrodynamic BEM input data, calculate body forces and pass forces 
and motions to other Simulink blocks.

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/body_diagram.PNG
   :width: 750pt

Body Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, 
users must initialize each iteration of the body class (``bodyClass``), and 
specify the location of the hydrodynamic data file (``<bemData>.h5``) and geometry 
file (``<geomFile>.stl``) for each body. The body class is defined by including the 
following lines in the WEC-Sim input file, where ``i`` is the body number and 
'<bem_data>.h5' is the name of the h5 file containing the BEM results:: 

    body(i)=bodyClass('<bemData>.h5')
    body(i).geometryFile = '<geomFile>.stl'; 

WEC-Sim bodies may be one of four types\: hydrodynamic, flexible, 
drag, or nonhydrodynamic. These types represent varying degrees of complexity
and require various input parameters and BEM data, detailed in the table below.
The :ref:`user-advanced-features-body` section contains more details on these
important distinctions.

Users may specify other body class properties using the ``body`` object for 
each body in the ``wecSimInputFile.m``. 
Important body class properties include quantities such as 
the mass, moment of inertia, center of gravity and center of buoyancy. 
Other parameters are specified as needed.
For example, viscous drag can be specified by entering the viscous drag 
coefficient and the characteristic area in vector format the WEC-Sim 
input file as follows:: 

    body(i).quadDrag.cd = [0 0 1.3 0 0 0]
    body(i).quadDrag.area = [0 0 100 0 0 0]

Available body properties, default values, and functions can be found by typing 
``doc bodyClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or opening the ``bodyClass.m`` 
file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing ``open bodyClass`` in 
Matlab Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's body class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-body`.

.. Note::
    The ``*.h5`` file defines the hydrodynamic data for all relevant bodies. It is 
    required that any drag body or nonhydrodyamic body be numbered after all 
    hydrodynamic bodies The body index must correspond with the index in the 
    ``*.h5`` file and the number in the Simulink diagram. 

Body Blocks
""""""""""""""

The Body Class is most closely associated with the Body Elements library.
The Body Elements library shown below contains four body types in two blocks: 
the ``Rigid Body`` block and the ``Flex Body`` block. The rigid body block is 
used to represent hydrodynamic, nonhydrodynamic, and drag bodies. Each type of 
rigid body is a `Variant Sub-system <https://www.mathworks.com/help/simulink/slref/variant-subsystems.html>`_. 
Before simulation, one variant is activated by a flag in the body object 
(body.nonHydro=0,1,2). The flex body block is used to represent hydrodynamic 
bodies that contain additional flexible degrees of freedom ('generalized body 
modes'). The flex body is determined automatically by the degrees of freedom 
contained in the BEM input data. At least one instance of a body 
block (rigid or flex) is required in each model. The 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-body` section describes the various types of 
WEC-Sim bodies in detail. 

Both in Simulink and the input file, the user has to name the blocks 
``body(i)`` (where i=1,2,...). The mass properties, hydrodynamic data, geometry 
file, mooring, and other properties are then specified in the input file. 
Within the body block, the wave radiation, wave excitation, hydrostatic 
restoring, viscous damping, and mooring forces are calculated.

.. _user-code-structure-constraint-class:

Constraint Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WEC-Sim constraint class and blocks connect WEC bodies to one another (and 
possibly to the seabed) by constraining DOFs. Constraint objects do not apply 
any force or resistance to body motion outside of the reactive force required 
to prevent motion in a given DOF. At a high level, the constraint class 
interacts with the rest of WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below. Constraint 
objects largely interact with other blocks through Simscape connections that 
pass resistive forces to other bodies, constraints, ptos, etc. 

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/constraint_diagram.PNG
   :width: 750pt

Constraint Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The properties of the constraint class (``constraintClass``) are defined in the 
``constraint`` object. Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users must initialize 
each iteration the constraint class (``constraintClass``) and specify the 
``constraintName``, by including the following lines:: 

    constraint(i)=constraintClass('<constraintName>'); 

For rotational constraint (ex: pitch), users may also specify the 
location and orientation of the rotational joint with respect to the global 
reference frame::
    
    constraint(i).location = [<x> <y> <z>];
    constraint(i).orientation.z = [<x> <y> <z>];
    constraint(i).orientation.y = [<x> <y> <z>];

Available constraint properties, default values, and functions can be found by 
typing ``doc constraintClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or opening the 
`constraintClass.m` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing 
``open constraintClass`` in MATLAB Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's constraint class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-pto`. 

Constraint Blocks
""""""""""""""""""""

The Constraint Class is tied to the blocks within the Constraints library.
These are used to define the DOF of a 
specific body. Constraint blocks define only the DOF, but do not otherwise 
apply any forcing or resistance to the body motion. Each Constraint block has 
two connections: a base (B) and a follower (F). The Constraints block restricts 
the motion of the block that is connected to the follower relative to the block 
that is connected to the base. For a single body system, the base would be the 
``Global Reference Frame`` and the follower is a ``Rigid Body``.

A brief description of each constraint block is given below. More information 
can also be found by double clicking on the library block and viewing the Block 
Parameters box.

.. _user-code-structure-pto-class:

PTO Class
^^^^^^^^^

WEC-Sim Power Take-Off (PTO) blocks connect WEC bodies to one other (and 
possibly to the seabed) by constraining DOFs and applying linear damping and 
stiffness. The ability to apply damping, stiffness, or other external forcing 
differentiates a 'PTO' from a 'Constraint'. The damping and stiffness allow a
pto to extract power from relative body motion with respect to a fixed reference 
frame or another body. 

At a high level, the PTO class interacts with the rest of WEC-Sim as shown in 
the diagram below. PTO objects largely interact with other blocks through 
Simscape connections that pass resistive forces to other bodies, constraints, 
ptos, etc.

   :width: 750pt

PTO Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The properties of the PTO class (``ptoClass``) are 
defined in the ``pto`` object. Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users must 
initialize each iteration the pto class (``ptoClass``) and specify the  
``ptoName``, by including the following lines:: 

    pto(i) = ptoClass('<ptoName>');

For rotational ptos, the user also needs to specify the location of the 
rotational joint with respect to the global reference frame in the 
``pto(i).location`` variable. In the PTO class, users can also specify 
linear damping (``pto(i).damping``) and stiffness (``pto(i).stiffness``) values to 
represent the PTO system (both have a default value of 0). Users can overwrite 
the default values in the input file. For example, users can specify a damping 
value by entering the following in the WEC-Sim input file:: 

    pto(i).damping = <ptoDamping>;
    pto(i).stiffness = <ptoStiffness>;

Available pto properties, default values, and functions can be found by typing 
``doc ptoClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or opening the `ptoClass.m` file 
in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by typing ``open ptoClass`` in MATLAB 
Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's pto class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-pto`. 

PTO Blocks
""""""""""""""

The PTO Class is tied to the PTOs library.
Similar to the Constraint blocks, the PTO blocks have a base (B) and
a follower (F). Users must name each PTO block ``pto(i)`` 
(where i=1,2,...) and then define their properties in the input file. 

The ``Translational PTO``, ``Spherical PTO``, and ``Rotational PTO`` are identical to the 
``Translational``, ``Spherical``, and ``Rotational`` constraints, but they allow for the 
application of linear damping and stiffness forces. Additionally, there are two 
other variations of the Translational and Rotational PTOs. The Actuation 
Force/Torque PTOs allow the user to define the PTO force/torque at each 
time-step and provide the position, velocity and acceleration of the PTO at 
each time-step. The user can use the response information to calculate the PTO 
force/torque. The Actuation Motion PTOs allow the user to define the motion of 
the PTO. These can be useful to simulate forced-oscillation tests.

   :align: center

.. Note::
    When using the Actuation Force/Torque PTO or Actuation Motion PTO blocks, 
    the loads and displacements are specified in the local (not global) 
    coordinate system. This is true for both the sensed (measured) and actuated 
    (commanded) loads and displacements.


.. _user-code-structure-cable-class:

Cable Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WEC-Sim Cable blocks connect WEC bodies to one other by a cable. 
They allows users to apply damping and/or stiffness when the cable is in tension, 
but allow no forcing in compression. 
At a high level, the cable class interacts with the rest of WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below.

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/cable_diagram.PNG
   :width: 750pt

Cable Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The properties of the cable class (``cableClass``) are defined in the ``cable`` object. 
Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users must initialize the cable class and specify the 
``cableName``, in addition to the ``baseConnection`` and ``followerConnection`` (in that order), by including the following lines:: 

    cable(i) = cableClass('cableName','baseConnection','followerConnection');
    cable(i).damping = <cableDamping>;
    cable(i).stiffness = <cableStiffness>;

Available cable properties, default values, and functions 
can be found by typing ``doc cableClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or 
opening the `cableClass.m` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by 
typing ``open cableClass`` in MATLAB Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's mooring class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-cable`.

Cable Block
""""""""""""""""""""

The Cable Class is tied to the Cables library.
The ``Cable`` block applies linear damping and stiffness based on 
the motion between the base and follower. 
Cables can be used between two bodies to apply a coupling force only when taut or stretched. 
A cable block must be added to the model between two PTOs or constraints that are to be connected by the cable.

.. _user-code-structure-mooring-class:

Mooring Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The mooring class (``mooringClass``) allows for different fidelity simulations 
of mooring systems. Two possibilities are available, a lumped mooring matrix or 
MoorDyn. These differences are determined by the Simulink block chosen, and are 
described below. At a high level, the Mooring class interacts with the rest of 
WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below. The interaction is similar to a 
constraint or PTO, where some resistive forcing is calculated and passed to a 
body block through a Simscape connection. 

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/mooring_diagram.PNG
   :width: 750pt

Mooring Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The properties of the mooring class (``mooringClass``) are defined in the 
``mooring`` object. Within the ``wecSimInputFile.m``, users must initialize 
the mooring class and specify the ``mooringName``, by including the following lines:: 

    mooring(i)= mooringClass('<mooringName>');

Available mooring properties, default values, and functions 
can be found by typing ``doc mooringClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or 
opening the `mooringClass.m` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by 
typing ``open mooringClass`` in MATLAB Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's mooring class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-mooring`.

Mooring Blocks
""""""""""""""""""""

The Mooring Class is tied to the Moorings library.
Two types of blocks may be used\: a 'Mooring Matrix' or a 'MoorDyn' system.
The ``MooringMatrix`` block applies linear damping and stiffness based on 
the motion of the follower relative to the base. 
Damping and stiffness can be specified between all DOFs in a 6x6 matrix.
The ``MoorDyn`` block uses the compiled MoorDyn 
executables and a MoorDyn input file to simulate a realistic mooring system. 
There can only be one MoorDyn block per Simulink model. There are no 
restrictions on the number of MooringMatrix blocks.

.. _user-code-structure-ptosim-class:

PTO-Sim Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The PTO-Sim class contains all the information for the PTO-Sim blocks, which can be used to simulate PTO systems. 
The difference beetween the PTO-Sim class and the PTO class is that the PTO-Sim class have detailed models of different components
that are used in PTO systems such as hydraulic cylinders, hydraulic accumulators, hydraulic motors, electric generators, etc., 
while the PTO class have a linear parametric model that summarizes the PTO dynamics with a stiffness and a damping term.
At a high level, the PTO-Sim class interacts with the rest of 
WEC-Sim as shown in the diagram below:

.. figure:: /_static/images/code_structure/PTOSimClass_diagram.png
   :width: 750pt

The PTO-Sim blocks receive the linear or angular response from the PTO blocks and give either the torque or the force depending on the PTO dynamics.

PTO-Sim Class Initialization
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The properties of the PTO-Sim class (``ptoSimClass``) are defined in the ``ptoSim`` object. The PTO-Sim class must be
initialized in the ``wecSimInputFile.m`` script. There are three properties that must be initialized for all the PTO-Sim blocks,
those are the name, the block number, and the type:: 

    ptoSim(i) = ptoSimClass('ptoSimName');
    ptoSim(i).ptoSimNum = i;
    ptoSim(i).ptoSimType = <TypeNumber>;

The type value must be defined depending on the type of block used in the simulation as follows:

+---------------------+-----+
|    PTO-Sim Library        |
+=====================+=====+
|Block                |Type |

Available PTO-Sim blocks properties, default values, and functions 
can be found by typing ``doc ptoSimClass`` in the MATLAB command window, or 
opening the `ptoSimClass.m` file in ``$WECSIM/source/objects`` directory by 
typing ``open ptoSimClass`` in MATLAB Command Window. 
For more information about application of WEC-Sim's mooring class, refer to 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-pto`.

PTO-Sim Blocks
""""""""""""""""""""

There are eight different types of blocks in the PTO-Sim class divided
in three sub-categories: Hydraulic, Electric, and Motion Conversion. In the hydraulic sub-category
there are five blocks: Check Valve, Compressible Fluid Piston, 
Gas-Charged Hydraulic Accumulator, Hydraulic Motor, and Rectifying Check Valve.
In the Electric sub-category there is a block call Electric Generator Equivalent Circuit which models an electric generator
with an equivalent circuit. The motion conversion blocks (Rotary to Linear Adjustable Rod, and
Rotary to Linear Crank) can be used to to convert rotational motion into linear motion to add a hydraulic cylinder
to the PTO model. There are no restrictions on the number of PTO-Sim blocks.

.. _user-code-structure-response-class:

Response Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The response class contains all the output time-series and methods to plot and 
interact with the results. It is not initialized by the user, and there is no 
related Simulink block. Instead, it is 
created automatically at the end of a WEC-Sim simulation. The response class 
does not input any parameter back to WEC-Sim, only taking output data from the 
various objects and blocks.

After WEC-Sim is done running, there will be a new variable called ``output`` 
saved to the MATLAB workspace. The ``output`` object is an instance of the 
``responseClass``. It contains all the relevant time-series results of the 
simulation. Time-series are given as [# of time-steps x 6] arrays, where 6 is the degrees of freedom. 
Refer to the WEC-Sim API documentation for the :ref:`response` for 
information about the structure of the ``output`` object, . 


.. _user-code-structure-functions:

Functions & External Codes
--------------------------

While the bulk of the WEC-Sim code consists of the WEC-Sim classes and the 
WEC-Sim library, the source code also includes supporting functions and 
external codes. These include third party Matlab functions to read ``*.h5`` and 
``*.stl`` files, WEC-Sim Matlab functions to write ``*.h5`` files and run 
WEC-Sim in batch mode, MoorDyn compiled executables, python macros for ParaView 
visualization, and the PTO-Sim class and library. Additionally, BEMIO can be 
used to create the hydrodynamic ``*.h5`` file required by WEC-Sim. MoorDyn is 
an open source code that must be downloaded separately. Users may also obtain, 
modify, and recompile the code as desired.


.. _user-code-structure-external-blocks:

External Simulink/Simscape Blocks
---------------------------------

In some situations, users may want to use Simulink/Simscape blocks that are not 
included in the WEC-Sim Library to build their WEC model. 
External blocks may be linked to the standard WEC-Sim library to implement
controllers, additional bodies, complex power take-offs and other custom designs.

.. Note::
    The Simulink Mechanism Configuration for automatic gravity calculations is
    not used in WEC-Sim. Gravity is instead defined as a force that is 
    combined with the buoyancy force. 
    Users who wish to add external bodies should account for gravity by:
    
    1. Create nonhydrodynamic bodies with zero displaced volume, or
    2. Manually add the gravity force into their external functionality
