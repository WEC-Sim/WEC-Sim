Overview
========

MOST (Matlab for Offshore Simulation Tool), is a simulation tool operating in the WEC-Sim environment for simulating floating offshore wind turbines, hybrid wind-wave energy converters, platforms with multiple turbines, etc. 
MOST builds on WEC-Sim in MATLAB/Simulink to add ``windClass`` and ``windTurbineClass`` objects that can define a given turbine and weather conditions.
Currently, MOST supports single-tower, three-bladed, horizontal-axis wind turbines controlled by Baseline or ROSCO controllers and providing geometric and inertial data as input.

MOST Developers
---------------
MOST is developed and maintained by the MORE Energy Lab, Politecnico di Torino, Italy.
The WEC-Sim+MOST coupling is a collaboration between the MORE Energy Lab and the WEC-Sim developers at Sandia National Laboratories and the National Renewable Energy Lab. 

Current members of the MOST development team include:

* Giovanni Bracco (PI)
* Emilio Faraggiana
* Alberto Ghigo
* Davide Issoglio
* Ermando Petracca
* Massimo Sirigu

.. TODO - list former MOST developers as appropriate
