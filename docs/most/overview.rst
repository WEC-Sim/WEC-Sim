Overview
========

MOST is an open-source software that simulates the behavior of an Offshore Floating Wind Turbine (OFWT) in specific weather conditions.
MOST builds on WEC-Sim in MATLAB/Simulink to add a ``windClass`` and ``windTurbineClass`` objects that can define a given turbine and weather conditions.
Currently, MOST supports single-tower, three-bladed, horizontal axis wind turbines defined by mass properties, aerodynamic loading and a ROSCO controller.
