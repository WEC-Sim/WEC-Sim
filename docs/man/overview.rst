Overview
========
This section provides an overview of the WEC-Sim work flow and development. First, the WEC-Sim file structure is described, then steps for setting up and running a WEC-Sim case is described. The section concludes with information on current development efforts and how contributor can suggest new features.

Workflow
-----------------
The WEC-Sim workflow diagram below shows a high level view of WEC-Sim's function. As a precursor, a functional WEC design with several forms of data must be included. 
The WEC is defined in an input file. This input file is read by WEC-Sim which instantiates objects based on the device requirements. The objects are used in conjunction with WEC-Sim's Simulink library during the time-domain simulation. 
User defined functions serve for easy post-processing and visualization of WEC-Sim's output. 
A detailed description of this workflow is provided in the following sections. 
For information about the implementation and structure of the WEC-Sim source code, refer to the :ref:`code_structure` section.

WEC-Sim Input Files
---------------------
Before WEC-Sim can be used, a wave energy converter design must exist. This design must include a surface mesh, frequency-based hydrodynamic data from a boundary element method solver, and a Simulink/Simscape model of the WEC. The WEC's geometry and other parameters must be detailed in the wecSimInputFile. All files required for a WEC-Sim simulation must be contained within a case directory referred to as ``$CASE``. This directory can be located anywhere on your computer. The table below lists the WEC-Sim case directory structure and required files. 

==================   ====================== ====================
**File Type**        **File Name**     	    **Directory**
Hydrodynamic Data    ``*.h5``   	    ``$CASE/hydroData``
Geometry File        ``*.stl`` 		    ``$CASE/geometry``
Simulink Model       ``*.slx``              ``$CASE``
Input File           ``wecSimInputFile.m``  ``$CASE``
==================   ====================== ====================

.. Note:: 
	Where ``*`` denotes a user-specified file name. 

Hydrodynamic Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Hydrodynamic coefficients for each body may be generated using a boundary element method (BEM) code (e.g., **WAMIT**, **NEMOH** or **AQWA**). The WEC-Sim code requires hydrodynamic data from the BEM solution in the form of HDF5 format (``*.h5`` file). This ``*.h5`` hydrodynamic data file can be generated using the BEMIO pre-processor. BEMIO (Boundary Element Method Input/Output) is a code developed by the WEC-Sim team to process BEM output files from **WAMIT**, **NEMOH**, and **AQWA** into a data structure than can be read by WEC-Sim. For more information about the BEMIO pre-processor, refer to the :ref:`bemio` section.


Geometry File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The WEC-Sim code also requires a geometry file (``*.stl``) that defines the outer surface of the device. Most CAD programs can export a geometry as a ``*.stl`` file. When running WEC-Sim with linear hydrodynamics, the ``*.stl`` is only used for the Simscape Mechanics Explorer visualization. However, when running WEC-Sim with nonlinear buoyancy and Froude-Krylov forces the mesh determines the instantaneous wetted surface at each time step. In this nonlinear case, the quality of the ``*.stl`` mesh is critical, refer to the :ref:`nonlinear` section for more information. 


Simulink Model 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to an input file, all WEC-Sim runs require a Simulink/Simscape model file (``*.slx``). This Simulink/Simscape model is defined using the WEC-Sim library blocks. Additional components or power take-off systems can be created in this file and coupled with the WEC geometry.

An example Simulink model file for the OSWEC is shown below. For more information about the OSWEC, and how to build WEC-Sim Simulink models, refer to the :ref:`tutorials` section.

.. figure:: /_static/images/OSWEC_Model.png
   :width: 200pt
   :align: center   


Input File
^^^^^^^^^^

A WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``) is required for each run. The 
input file **MUST** be named ``wecSimInputFile.m`` and placed within the case 
directory. WEC-Sim uses `object orientated programming 
<https://uk.mathworks.com/discovery/object-oriented-programming.html>`__ to 
describe components of the WEC model; the main structure of the input file 
consists of initializing all the objects necessary to run WEC-Sim simulations 
and defining any user specified properties for each object. 
Specifically, the input file requires initialization and definition of the simulation and wave classes, at least one instance of the body class, and at least one instance of the constraint or PTO classes. For details about WEC-Sim's objects and available properties for each object, refer to the :ref:`man/code_structure:WEC-Sim Objects` section. 

An example WEC-Sim input file is shown below for the OSWEC. 
Additional examples are provided in the :ref:`tutorials` section.
WEC-Sim is an object oriented code and the input file reflects this by instantiating the WEC-Sim classes to create objects that are tied to the Simulink library.

The WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``) for the OSWEC initializes and specifies properties for the simulation, body, constraint and pto classes.

Running WEC-Sim
-----------------
This section provides a description of the steps to run the WEC-Sim code, refer to the :ref:`WEC-Sim Workflow Diagram <workFlow>` while following the steps to run WEC-Sim.


Step 1: Pre-Processing 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the pre-processing step, users need to create the WEC geometry, and run a BEM code to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients.

* **Create WEC Geometry**: 

   * Create CAD models of the WEC geometry and export it to a ``*.stl`` format. 
   * The ``*.stl`` files are used to visualize the WEC response in Simscape Explorer
   * They are also used for :ref:`nonlinear` forces if the option is enabled.

* **Compute Hydrodynamic Coefficients**: WEC-Sim requires frequency-domain hydrodynamic coefficients (e.g. added mass, radiation damping, and wave excitation). 

   * The coefficients for each body may be generated using a boundary element method (BEM) code (e.g., **WAMIT**, **NEMOH** or **AQWA**). 
   * WEC-Sim requires that all hydrodynamic coefficients must be specified at **the center of gravity** for each body.


Step 2: Generate Hydrodata File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this step, users run :ref:`BEMIO<bemio>` to convert the hydrodynamic coefficients from their BEM solution into the ``*.h5`` format for WEC-Sim to read:

* **Run BEMIO**: to generate ``*.h5`` Hydrodynamic Coefficients for WEC-Sim

   * The hydrodynamic coefficients for each body generated from the BEM code can be parsed into a ``*.h5`` data structure using :ref:`BEMIO<bemio>`, which was developed by the WEC-Sim team.
   * BEMIO currently supports WAMIT, NEMOH and AQWA. 


.. Note:: 
   * **If WAMIT is used:**
   
      * The origin of the body coordinate system (XBODY, defined in ``*.pot``) as well as the mesh for each body must be at the center of gravity.
      * The WAMIT mesh (``*.gdf``) can be generated using `Rhino <https://www.rhino3d.com>`_ or `MultiSurf <http://www.aerohydro.com/WAMIT.htm>`_.
      * More details on WAMIT setup are given in the `WAMIT User Manual <http://www.wamit.com/manual.htm>`_.

   * **If NEMOH is used:** 
   
      * The origin of the mesh for each body (``*.dat``) is located at the mean water surface, which follows the same coordinate used in WEC-Sim. 
      * The location to output the hydrodynamic coefficients for each degree of freedom is defined in the ``Nemoh.cal`` file.
      * Please refer to `NEMOH-Mesh <https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-mesh-192932.kjsp?RH=1489593406974>`_ webpage for more mesh generation details.
      * The NEMOH Mesh.exe code creates the ``Hydrostatics.dat`` and ``KH.dat`` files (among other files) for one input body at a time. For the Read_NEMOH function to work correctly in the case of a multiple body system, the user must manually rename ``Hydrostatics.dat`` and ``KH.dat`` files to ``Hydrostatics_0.dat``, ``Hydrostatics_1.dat``, …, and ``KH_0.dat``, ``KH_1.dat``,…, corresponding to the body order specified in the ``Nemoh.cal`` file.
      * More details on NEMOH setup are given in the `Nemoh Homepage <https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-running-192930.kjsp?RH=1489593406974>`_.
      
   * **If AQWA is used:** 
   
      * The origin of the global coordinate system is at the mean water surface, and the origin of the body coordinate system for each body must be at the center of gravity (defined using the AQWA GUI or in the ``*.dat`` input file).
      * In order to run BEMIO, AQWA users must output both the default ``*.LIS`` file and output the ``*.AH1`` hydrodynamic database file. Both of these files are reacquired to run BEMIO. 
      * More details on AQWA setup are given in the AQWA Reference Manual.

.. Note:: 
	Users are also able to specify their own hydrodynamic coefficients by creating their own ``*.h5`` file with customized hydrodynamic coefficients following the ``*.h5`` format created by BEMIO.

.. Note:: 
	
	We recommend installing HDFview https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/ to view the ``*.h5`` files generated by BEMIO.

Step 3: Build Simulink Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this step, users build their WEC-Sim Simulink model (``*.slx``) using the :ref:`man/code_structure:WEC-Sim Library` developed in Simulink/Simscape. 
The ``*.slx`` Simulink model file must be located in the ``$CASE`` directory. 
The figure below shows an example WEC-Sim Simulink model for the OSWEC tutorial.

.. figure:: /_static/images/OSWEC_Model.png
   :width: 200pt
   :align: center       
   

Step 4: Write wecSimInputFile.m
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The WEC-Sim input file must be located in the ``$CASE`` directory, and named ``wecSimInputFile.m``. The figure below shows an example of a WEC-Sim input file. The input file specifies the simulation settings, body mass properties, wave conditions, joints, and mooring. Additionally, the WEC-Sim input file must specify the location of the WEC-Sim Simulink model (``*.slx``) file, the geometry file(s) ``*.stl``, and the hydrodynamic data file (``*.h5``) .

Step 5: Run WEC-Sim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lastly, execute the WEC-Sim code by typing ``wecSim`` into the MATLAB Command Window. 
The WEC-Sim source code is located in the ``$WECSIM`` directory, but ``wecSim`` must be executed from the ``$CASE`` directory.

.. Note::
	WEC-Sim simulations should always be executed from the MATLAB Command Window, not from Simulink.


WEC-Sim Development
-----------------------------
The `WEC-Sim development team <http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim/index.html#wec-sim-developers>`_ is currently engaged in continuous code development and support. Efforts are made by the development team to improve the code's flexibility, accuracy, and usability.


Online Forum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please post questions about WEC-Sim on the `Issues Page <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/issues>`_. This forum is managed and continuously monitored by the WEC-Sim code development team and users. The issues page is frequently used to interact with the WEC-Sim community, ask questions, request new features, and report bugs. 


Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The WEC-Sim team currently uses a fork-pull request based development workflow. In this system, features are incorporated into the development branch ('dev') of the WEC-Sim repository by a pull request (PR) from an individual's fork.
Contributors who wish to propose new features or improvements to WEC-Sim should follow the same workflow so their suggestions can be evaluated and implemented easily. First, follow the :ref:`man/getting_started:Developer Instructions` to fork the repository.

A pull request should focus on one feature or update at a time. 
This ensures that bugs within a PR are easily identified, and the repository history remains clean and straightforward. 
Fixing many issues within a single PR, often leads to hard-to-track changes and difficulty in merging the branch. 
If multiple PRs are submitted, use different branches on your fork to keep track of them. 
Delete branches once a PR is closed to keep your fork clean.

To submit a pull request of your feature, first pull the latest commits to the WEC-Sim/master branch::

	>> git pull origin master

Merge any conflicts that occur when pulling the latest updates, and implement your changes. Commit changes and push them to your fork::

	>> git commit -m 'commit message'
	>> git push REMOTE_NAME BRANCH_NAME

Run the software test (below). If successful, you may submit a PR for your improvements. Navigate to the `WEC-Sim repository <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/pulls>`_ on GitHub and click 'New Pull Request'.
For more details on submitting pull requests, see the `About pull requests <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_ documentation on GitHub
