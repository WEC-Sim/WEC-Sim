WEC-Sim Model Files
---------------------
All files required for a WEC-Sim simulation must be contained within a case directory referred to as ``$CASE``. 
This directory can be located anywhere on your computer. 
The table below list the WEC-Sim case directory structure and required files. 

==================   ====================== ====================
**File Type**        **File Name**     	    **Directory**
Hydrodynamic Data    ``*.h5``   	    ``$CASE/hydroData``
Geometry File        ``*.stl`` 		    ``$CASE/geometry``
Simulink Model       ``*.slx``              ``$CASE``
Input File           ``wecSimInputFile.m``  ``$CASE``
==================   ====================== ====================

.. Note:: 
	Where ``*`` denotes a user-specified file name. 

Hydrodynamic Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The Hydrodynamic coefficients for each body may be generated using a boundary element method (BEM) code (e.g., **WAMIT**, **NEMOH** or **AQWA**). 
* The WEC-Sim code also requires hydrodynamic data from the BEM solution in the form of HDF5 format (``*.h5`` file).
* This ``*.h5`` hydrodynamic data file can be generated using the BEMIO pre-processor.
* BEMIO (Boundary Element Method Input/Output) is a code developed by the WEC-Sim team to process BEM output files from **WAMIT**, **NEMOH**, and **AQWA** into a data structure than can be read by WEC-Sim. 
* For more information about the BEMIO pre-processor, refer to the :ref:`bemio` section.


Geometry File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The WEC-Sim code also requires a geometry file in the form of a ``*.stl`` file. Most CAD programs can export the geometry as a ``*.stl`` file.
* This ``*.stl`` file is used by the WEC-Sim code to generate the Simscape Mechanics Explorer visualization, and by the nonlinear buoyancy and Froude-Krylov forces option to determine the instantaneous wetted surface at each time step. 
* When running WEC-Sim with linear hydrodynamics, the ``*.stl`` is only used for visualization. 
* When running WEC-Sim with nonlinear buoyancy and Froude-Krylov forces, the quality of the ``*.stl`` mesh is critical, refer to the :ref:`nonlinear` section for more information. 


Simulink Model 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* In addition to an input file, all WEC-Sim runs require a Simulink model file (``*.slx``). An example Simulink model file for the OSWEC is shown below. 
* For more information about the OSWEC, and how to build WEC-Sim Simulink models, refer to the :ref:`tutorials` section.

Input File 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* A WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``) is required for each run. The input file **MUST** be named ``wecSimInputFile.m`` and placed within the case directory. 
* The main structure of the input file consists of initializing all the objects necessary to run WEC-Sim simulations, and defining any user specified properties for each object.
* The input file for each WEC-Sim simulation requires initialization and definition of the simulation and wave classes, at least one instance of the body class, and at least one instance of the constraint or PTO classes.
* For details about WEC-Sim's objects and available properties for each object, refer to the :ref:`man/code_structure:WEC-Sim Objects` section.

An example WEC-Sim input file is shown below for the OSWEC. 
Additional examples are provided in the :ref:`tutorials` section.
WEC-Sim is an object oriented code and the input file reflects this.
The WEC-Sim input file (``wecSimInputFile.m``) for the OSWEC initializes and specifies properties for simulation, body, constraint and pto classes.

Running WEC-Sim
-----------------
This section provides a description of the steps to run the WEC-Sim code, refer to the :ref:`WEC-Sim Workflow Diagram <workFlow>` while following the steps to run WEC-Sim.


Step 1: Pre-Processing 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the pre-processing step, users need to create the WEC geometry, and run a BEM code to calculate the hydrodynamic coefficients.

* **Create WEC Geometry**: 

   * Create CAD models of the WEC geometry and export it to a ``*.stl`` format. 
   * The ``*.stl`` files are used to visualize the WEC response in Simscape Explorer
   * They are also used for :ref:`nonlinear` forces if the option is enabled.

* **Compute Hydrodynamic Coefficients**: WEC-Sim requires frequency-domain hydrodynamic coefficients (e.g. added mass, radiation damping, and wave excitation). 

   * The coefficients for each body may be generated using a boundary element method (BEM) code (e.g., **WAMIT**, **NEMOH** or **AQWA**). 
   * WEC-Sim requires that all hydrodynamic coefficients must be specified at **the center of gravity** for each body.


Step 2: Generate Hydrodata File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this step, users run :ref:`BEMIO<bemio>` to convert the hydrodynamic coefficients from their BEM solution into the ``*.h5`` format for WEC-Sim to read:

* **Run BEMIO**: to generate ``*.h5`` Hydrodynamic Coefficients for WEC-Sim

   * The hydrodynamic coefficients for each body generated from the BEM code can be parsed into a ``*.h5`` data structure using :ref:`BEMIO<bemio>`, which was developed by the WEC-Sim team.
   * BEMIO currently supports WAMIT, NEMOH and AQWA. 


.. Note:: 
   * **If WAMIT is used:**
   
      * The origin of the body coordinate system (XBODY, defined in ``*.pot``) as well as the mesh for each body must be at the center of gravity.
      * The WAMIT mesh (``*.gdf``) can be generated using `Rhino <https://www.rhino3d.com>`_ or `MultiSurf <http://www.aerohydro.com/WAMIT.htm>`_.
      * More details on WAMIT setup are given in the `WAMIT User Manual <http://www.wamit.com/manual.htm>`_.

   * **If NEMOH is used:** 
   
      * The origin of the mesh for each body (``*.dat``) is located at the mean water surface, which follows the same coordinate used in WEC-Sim. 
      * The location to output the hydrodynamic coefficients for each degree of freedom is defined in the ``Nemoh.cal`` file.
      * Please refer to `NEMOH-Mesh <https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-mesh-192932.kjsp?RH=1489593406974>`_ website for more mesh generation details.
      * The NEMOH Mesh.exe code creates the ``Hydrostatics.dat`` and ``KH.dat`` files (among other files) for one input body at a time. For the Read_NEMOH function to work correctly in the case of a multiple body system, the user must manually rename ``Hydrostatics.dat`` and ``KH.dat`` files to ``Hydrostatics_0.dat``, ``Hydrostatics_1.dat``, …, and ``KH_0.dat``, ``KH_1.dat``,…, corresponding to the body order specified in the ``Nemoh.cal`` file.
      * More details on NEMOH setup are given in the `Nemoh Homepage <https://lheea.ec-nantes.fr/logiciels-et-brevets/nemoh-running-192930.kjsp?RH=1489593406974>`_.
      
   * **If AQWA is used:** 
   
      * The origin of the global coordinate system is at the mean water surface, and the origin of the body coordinate system for each body must be at the center of gravity (defined using the AQWA GUI or in the ``*.dat`` input file).
      * In order to run BEMIO, AQWA users must output both the default ``*.LIS`` file and output the ``*.AH1`` hydrodynamic database file. Both of these files are reacquired to run BEMIO. 
      * More details on AQWA setup are given in the AQWA Reference Manual.

.. Note:: 
	Users are also able to specify their own hydrodynamic coefficients by creating their own ``*.h5Ste file with customized hydrodynamic coefficients following the ``*.h5`` format created by BEMIO.

.. Note:: 
	
	We recommend installing HDFview https://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/hdfview/ to view the ``*.h5`` files generated by BEMIO.

Step 3: Build Simulink Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this step, users build their WEC-Sim Simulink model (``*.slx``) using the :ref:`man/code_structure:WEC-Sim Library` developed in Simulink/Simscape. 
The ``*.slx`` Simulink model file must be located in the ``$CASE`` directory. 
The figure below shows an example WEC-Sim Simulink model for the OSWEC tutorial.

.. figure:: /_static/images/OSWEC_Model.png
   :width: 200pt
   :align: center       
   

Step 4: Write wecSimInputFile.m
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The WEC-Sim input file must be located in the ``$CASE`` directory, and named ``wecSimInputFile.m``. The figure below shows an example of a WEC-Sim input file. The input file specifies the simulation settings, body mass properties, wave conditions, joints, and mooring. Additionally, the WEC-Sim input file must specify the location of the WEC-Sim Simulink model (``*.slx``) file, the geometry file(s) ``*.stl``, and the hydrodynamic data file (``*.h5``) .

Step 5: Run WEC-Sim
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lastly, execute the WEC-Sim code by typing ``wecSim`` into the MATLAB Command Window. 
The WEC-Sim source code is located in the ``$WECSIM`` directory, but ``wecSim`` must be executed from the ``$CASE`` directory.

.. Note::
	WEC-Sim simulations should always be executed from the MATLAB Command Window, not from Simulink.

Software Tests
--------------------
This section describes the software tests developed to test the WEC-Sim source code. 
WEC-Sim includes continuous integration software tests. The tests are run each time changes are made to the repository, and are designed to ensure that the code is performing as expected. New tests are developed each time new functions are added or modified.
Refer to MATLAB's `unit test <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab-unit-test-framework.html?s_tid=CRUX_lftnav>`_ and `continuous integration <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/continuous-integration-with-matlab-on-ci-platforms.html>`_ documentation for more information. 


Run Tests
^^^^^^^^^^^
The WEC-Sim unit tests are located in the ``$WECSIM/tests`` directory. 
To run the WEC-Sim unit tests locally, navigate to the ``$WECSIM`` (e.g. ``C:/User/Documents/GitHub/WEC-Sim``) directory, and type the following command into the MATLAB Command Window::

	>> runtests
	
	
	Totals:
	   25 Passed, 0 Failed, 0 Incomplete.
	   

This executes the WEC-Sim tests and generates a build report. **Developers should run software tests before submitting a pull request.**
