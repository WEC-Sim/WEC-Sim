# [WEC-Sim Documentation](http://wec-sim.github.io/WEC-Sim)

## Compile Instructions

These instructions work for both Linux and Windows. For Windows, remember to
replace slashes (`/`) in paths with backslashes (`\ `).

### Setup Sphinx (One Time Only)

1. Install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

2. Create the Sphinx environment:
   
   ```
   > cd path/to/WEC-Sim
   > conda env create -y --file docs/environment.yml
   ```

### Testing the Current Branch

The documentation for the current branch can be built locally for inspection 
prior to publishing. They are built in the `docs/_build` directory. Note, 
unlike the final documentation, version tags and other branches will not be 
available. 

To test the current branch, use the following:

```
> conda activate _wssphinx
(_wssphinx) > cd path/to/WEC-Sim
(_wssphinx) > sphinx-build -W --keep-going -b html docs docs/_build/html
(_wssphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```
The front page of the docs can be accessed at 
`docs/_build/html/index.html`. 

### Building Final Version Locally

The final documentation can be built locally for inspection prior to 
publishing. They are built in the `docs/_build` directory. Note, docs are 
built from the remote so only pushed changes on the `master` and `dev` 
branches will be shown. To build the docs use the following command:

```
> conda activate _wssphinx
(_wssphinx) > cd path/to/WEC-Sim
(_wssphinx) > sphinx-multiversion -W --keep-going docs docs/_build/html
(_wssphinx) > conda deactivate
>
```

The front page of the docs can be accessed at 
`docs/_build/html/master/index.html`. 

### Publishing Final Version Remotely

The WEC-Sim docs are rebuilt automatically following every merge commit made 
to the master or dev branch of the [WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim](
https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim) repository.


## Best Practices
  - Always pad with whitespace and not tabs, especially when formatting tables
  - If using the `include` directive, place the included file in the `docs/_include` directory and link from there. For example:
      ```rst
      .. include:: /_include/added_mass.rst
      ```
  - Start each sentence on a new line (use a text editor with text-wrapping)
  - Whenever possible link to outside reference instead of write guidance available elsewhere (e.g. how to use Git, MATLAB/Simulink features)
  - Whenever possible link to other sections of the documentation instead of writing similar information in multiple places
  - Run spell check (not built into most text editors)
  - `sphinx-build -a -b html docs docs/_build/html` to build a clean verion of the website

### Formatting Guidelines
  - `$CASE` to refer to WEC-Sim case directory
  - `$WECSIM` to refer to WEC-Sim directory
  - `$WECSIM/source` to refer to WEC-Sim source directory
  - `body(i)` or `pto(i)` to refer to an instance of a class
  - `'<modelFile>.slx'` or `<wavePeriod>` when referring to user-input, but keep camelCase syntax
  - `*.mat` syntax to refer to file extension
  - use ``insert code`` to reference code
  - Title `####` with overline
  - Heading 1 `======`
  - Heading 2 `------`
  - Heading 3 `^^^^^^`
  - Heading 4 `""""""`
  - Heading 5 `++++++`
  - Use this style guide: https://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style-guide.html

### Terminology Guidelines
  - post-processing (not postprocessing)
  - pre-processing (not preprocessing)  
  - nondimensional (not non-dimensional)
  - nonlinear (not non-linear)
  - drivetrain (not drive-train)
