	This section is too shortly to really be useful. Might as well lump it with the getting started / introduction page as that's where the github is first pointed out.

Please post questions about WEC-Sim on the `Issues Page <https://github.com/WEC-Sim/WEC-Sim/issues>`_. This forum is managed by the WEC-Sim code development team and users. The issues page is used to interact with the WEC-Sim community, ask questions, request new features, and report bugs.
