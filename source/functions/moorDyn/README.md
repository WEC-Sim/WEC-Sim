--------------------- MoorDyn vV1.01.02 -------------------------

Copyright 2014-2016 Matt Hall <mtjhall@alumni.uvic.ca>

MoorDyn is a lumped-mass mooring line model intended for coupling with floating structure codes.

v1.01.02 corrects an error in v1.01.01C that caused instability at the seabed. Compared to v1.01.00C, it corrects issues with anchor tension outputs and with a missing weight term in fairlead tension outputs. It is released to bring MoorDyn v1 up to date while a beta version of MoorDyn v2 is prepared.
