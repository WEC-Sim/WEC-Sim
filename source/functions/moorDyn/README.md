--------------------- MoorDyn v2.2.1 -------------------------

Copyright 2014-2016 Matt Hall <mtjhall@alumni.uvic.ca>

MoorDyn is a lumped-mass mooring line model intended for coupling with floating structure codes.

v2 builds upon v1 by adding new features including rigid bodies and support for wave loading at 
the free surface. WEC-Sim works properly with MoorDyn v2, but compatibility of the new features 
in WEC-Sim is currently still under development.
