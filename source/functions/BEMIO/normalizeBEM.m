function hydro = normalizeBEM(hydro)
% Normalizes BEM hydrodynamic coefficients in the same manner
% that WAMIT outputs are normalized. Specifically, the linear restoring
% stiffness is normalized as :math:`C_{i,j}/(\rho g)`; added mass is normalized as
% :math:`A_{i,j}/\rho`; radiation damping is normalized as :math:`B_{i,j}/(\rho \omega)`; and,
% exciting forces are normalized as :math:`X_i/(\rho g)`. And, if necessary, sort
% data according to ascending frequency.
%
% This function is not called directly by the user; it is automatically
% implemented within the readWAMIT, readCAPYTAINE, readNEMOH, and readAQWA
% functions.
%
% Parameters
% ----------
%     hydro : [1 x 1] struct
%         Structure of hydro data that will be  normalized and sorted
%         depending on the value of hydro.code
%
% Returns
% -------
%     hydro : [1 x 1] struct
%         Normalized hydro data
%
