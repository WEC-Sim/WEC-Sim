function hydro = Normalize(hydro)

% Normalizes NEMOH and AQWA hydrodynamic coefficients in the same manner
% that WAMIT outputs are normalized. Specifically,the linear restoring
% stiffness is normalized as, C(i,j)/(rho*g); added mass is normalized as,
% A(i,j)/rho; radiation damping is normalized as, B(i,j)/(rho*w); and,
% exciting forces are normalized as, X(i)/(rho*g). And, if necessary, sort
% data according to ascending frequency.

%     hydro – data structure

% This function is not called directly by the user; it is automatically
% implemented within the Read_WAMIT, Read_NEMOH, and Read_AQWA functions.
