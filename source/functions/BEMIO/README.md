## BEMIO
BEMIO (Boundary Element Method Input/Output) is a pre-processing component of WEC-Sim. 
It reads output data from various BEM sources and writes an .h5 file that is input to WEC-Sim.
Must be run once per set of BEM data, so it is separate from the additional WEC-SIM pre-processing.

Examples of BEMIO scripts are given in WEC-Sim/source/examples/BEMIO. 
See the BEMIO Advanced Feature documentation for further detail on BEMIO and the hydro structure.
