Terminology
===========

.. note::
    This is a really useful page, but you might want to say something about it,
    especially since it's the first page of your documentation. As I said in the
    index, I would maybe have some direction for the docs otherwise this is the
    first page people will go to and might be like, "WHAAAAAT?". You might even
    consider putting it below the "Getting Started page".

.. note::
    This bit needs a section name, otherwise the variables list is at a lower 
    level and looks like it's of less importance, which I don't think it is.
