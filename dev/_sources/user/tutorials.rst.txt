Two-Body Point Absorber (RM3)
-----------------------------

This section describes the application of the WEC-Sim code to model the 
Reference Model 3 (RM3) two-body point absorber WEC. This tutorial is provided 
in the WEC-Sim code release in the ``$WECSIM/tutorials`` directory.

Device Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The RM3 two-body point absorber WEC has been characterized both numerically and 
experimentally as a result of the DOE-funded `Reference Model Project 
<http://energy.sandia.gov/rmp>`_. The RM3 is a two-body point absorber 
consisting of a float and a reaction plate. Full-scale dimensions and mass 
properties of the RM3 are shown below.

Model Files
^^^^^^^^^^^

Below is an overview of the files required to run the RM3 simulation in 
WEC-Sim. For the RM3 WEC, there are two corresponding geometry files: 
``float.stl`` and ``plate.stl``. In addition to the required files listed 
below, users may supply a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` file for post-processing 
results once the WEC-Sim run is complete. 

==================   =============================  ====================================
**File Type**        **File Name**                  **Directory**

RM3 Tutorial
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _user-tutorials-rm3-step-one:

Step 1: Run BEMIO
"""""""""""""""""

Hydrodynamic data for each RM3 body must be parsed into a HDF5 file using 
:ref:`user-advanced-features-bemio`. BEMIO converts hydrodynamic data from 
WAMIT, NEMOH, Aqwa, or Capytaine into a HDF5 file, ``*.h5`` that is then read by WEC-Sim. 
The RM3 tutorial includes data from a WAMIT run, ``rm3.out``, of the RM3 
geometry in the ``$WECSIM/tutorials/rm3/hydroData/`` directory. The RM3 WAMIT 
``rm3.out`` file and the BEMIO ``bemio.m`` script are then used to generate the 
``rm3.h5`` file. 

This is done by navigating to the ``$WECSIM/tutorials/rm3/hydroData/`` 
directory, and typing``bemio`` in the MATLAB Command Window:: 

	>> bemio
	

.. _user-tutorials-rm3-step-two:

Step 2: Build Simulink Model
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The WEC-Sim Simulink model is created by dragging and dropping blocks from the 
*WEC-Sim Library* into the ``rm3.slx`` file. When setting up a WEC-Sim model, 
it is very important to note the base and follower frames. The base port should 
always connect 'towards' the Global Reference Frame, while the follower port 
connects 'away' from the reference frame. Also, a base port should always 
connect to a follower port. The same port type should not be connected (i.e. no 
base-base or follower-follower connections). 

* Place two **Rigid Body** blocks from *Body Elements* in *WEC-Sim Library* in 
  the Simulink model file, one for each RM3 rigid body. 

* Double click on the **Rigid Body** block, and rename each instance of the 
  body. The first body must be called ``body(1)``, and the second body should be 
  called ``body(2)``. 

.. figure:: /_static/images/RM3_WECSim_Body.jpg
   :width: 400pt
   :align: center

* Place the **Global Reference Frame** from *Frames* in the *WEC-Sim Library* 
  in the Simulink model file. The global reference frame acts as the seabed. 


.. figure:: /_static/images/RM3_WECSim_GlobalRef.jpg
   :width: 400pt
   :align: center

* Place the **Floating (3DOF)** block from *Constrains* to connect the plate to 
  the seabed. This constrains the plate to move in 3DOF relative to the **Global 
  Reference Frame**. 

* Place the **Translational PTO** block from *PTOs* to connect the float to the 
  spar. This constrains the float to move in heave relative to the spar, and 
  allows definition of PTO damping.

   :align: center

.. _user-tutorials-rm3-step-three:

Step 3: Write wecSimInputFile.m
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The WEC-Sim input file defines simulation parameters, body properties, joints, 
and mooring for the RM3 model. The ``wecSimInputFile.m`` for the RM3 is 
provided in the RM3 case directory, and shown below. 

New users should manually write the wecSimInputFile.m to become familiar with 
the set-up parameters and the files being called in a basic WEC-Sim run. First, 
define the simulation parameters. Initialize an instance of the 
simulationClass. Define the simulink file to use, the start, ramp and end 
times, and the time step required. The simulation class also controls all 
relevant numerical options and simulation-wide parameters in a single 
convenient class. 

Next set-up the type of incoming wave by instantiating the waveClass. 'Regular' 
is a sinusoidal wave and the easiest to start with. Define an appropriate wave 
height and period. Waves can also be an irregular spectrum, imported by 
elevation or spectrum, or multidirectional. 

Third, define all bodies, PTOs and constraints present in the simulink file. 
There are distinct classes for bodies, PTOs and constraints that contain 
different properties and function differently. Bodies are hydrodynamic and 
contain mass and geometry properties. Initialize bodies by calling the 
bodyClass and the path to the relevant h5 file. Set the path to the geometry 
file, and define the body's mass properties. PTOs and constraints are more 
simple and contain forces and power dissipation (in the constraint) that limit 
the WEC's motion. PTOs and constraints can be set by calling the appropriate 
class with the Simulink block name. Set the location and any PTO damping or 
stiffness desired.

To execute the WEC-Sim code for the RM3 tutorial, type ``wecSim`` into the 
MATLAB Command Window. Below is a figure showing the final RM3 Simulink model 
and the WEC-Sim GUI during the simulation. For more information on using 
WEC-Sim to model the RM3 device, refer to :cite:`ruehl_preliminary_2014`.

Step 5: Post-processing
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The RM3 tutorial includes a ``userDefinedFunctions.m`` which plots RM3 
forces and responses. This file can be modified by users for 
post-processing. Additionally, once the WEC-Sim run is complete, the 
WEC-Sim results are saved to the ``output`` variable in the MATLAB 
workspace. 

.. _user-tutorials-oswec:

Oscillating Surge WEC (OSWEC)
-----------------------------

This section describes the application of the WEC-Sim code to model the 
Oscillating Surge WEC (OSWEC). This tutorial is provided in the WEC-Sim 
code release in the ``$WECSIM/tutorials`` directory. 

.. _user-tutorials-oswec-device-geometry:

Device Geometry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OSWEC was selected because its design is fundamentally different from the 
RM3. This is critical because WECs span an extensive design space, and it is 
important to model devices in WEC-Sim that operate under different principles. 
The OSWEC is fixed to the ground and has a flap that is connected through a 
hinge to the base that restricts the flap in order to pitch about the hinge. 
The full-scale dimensions and mass properties of the OSWEC are shown below.

+-------+-----------+------------------------+------------+------------+------------+

.. Note::
    The global frame lies at the undisturbed free surface. The body-fixed frame is at the center of gravity. Since the OSWEC is modeled as a pitch device, only the Iyy Moment of Inertia has been defined.
